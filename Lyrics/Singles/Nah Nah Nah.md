# Nah Nah Nah

Incoming  

Boy, we wasn't never no joke, nah, nah, nah  
All summer, murder he wrote, nah, nah, nah  
Who they talkin' 'bout? Nah, nah, nah  
Doin' everythin' they didn't allow, nah, nah  
Overthrow, send the drones in  
All the maneuvers, feelin' closed in  
I don't need to strike back, I let God fight my battles  
Ain't strapped with a TEC, laid it down, now where they at?  

Next time you text, can it wait?  
[[You are talkin' to a presidential candidate]]  
I know you think Obi-Wan gettin' tired now  
Don't jump, Anakin, I got the higher ground  
I'ma hit the moonwalk like I seen Tito  
Manâ€¦ like the President just got vetoed (Woo)  
Got to sign off for the veto, ayy  
I don't need to sign a release, I'm a freed old man  
This is a video game, this is a simulation, man  
How do you listen to lame? They the imitation, man  
Take an idea, live it, take a idea, did it  
Take an idea with it, just look how we get it  
Just look how we did it, can't tell me we ain't did it  
Can't tell me we ain't lived it, can't tell me we ain't lived it  
Just look how we get it, cartoons ain't timeless  
Cop cars ain't mind us, one call ain't wireless  

Boy, we wasn't never no joke, nah, nah, nah  
All summer, murder he wrote, nah, nah, nah  
Who they talkin' 'bout? Nah, nah, nah  
Doin' everythin' they didn't allow, nah, nah  
Overthrow, send the drones in  
All the maneuvers, feelin' closed in  
I don't need to strike back, I let God fight my battles  
Ain't strapped with a TEC, laid it down, now where they at?  

If I put myself in harm's way to get my own masters  
They'll put theyself in harm's way to stay the master  
They'll put theyself in harm's way 'cause they ain't askin'  
They'll put theyself in harm's way, the slaves are massive  

Do you want me to get specific?  
Do you want me to name numbers?  
Do you want me to name summers?  
All the stars came from us  
All the styles came from us  
All the talent came from us  
All the shoes came from us  
But the news ain't on us  
All the news ain't honest  
All the news ain't honest  
They wanna ignore me, rewrite the story  
Take all the top spots, in every category  
Back in fashion with them boys, can't ig-can't ignore me  

Boy, we wasn't never no joke, nah, nah, nah  
All summer, murder he wrote, nah, nah, nah  
Who they talkin' 'bout? Nah, nah, nah  
Doin' everythin' they didn't allow, nah, nah  
Overthrow, send the drones in  
All the maneuvers, feelin' closed in  
I don't need to strike back, I let God fight my battles  
Ain't strapped with a TEC, laid it down, now where they at?
