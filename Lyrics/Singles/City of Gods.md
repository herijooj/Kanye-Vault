New York City, please go easy on me tonight  
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine (What?)  

## [Verse 1: Fivio Foreign & _Playboi Carti_]

Yeah, look, huh, nigga, this is my shit  
Welcome to the city of Gods (What?)  
Pop was the king of New York, now I'm the nigga in charge  
Only the drillers, the city is ours  
We found out the [[opp|opps]] and we pick 'em apart  
I give 'em my time so I give 'em my heart  
If the city love me, then I'm really a star (What?)  

## [Chorus: Alicia Keys]

New York City, please go easy on me tonight  
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine  
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another  
New York City, please go easy on me  

## [Verse 2: Fivio Foreign & _Playboi Carti_]

Yeah, look, this is the city of money and violence  
Same thing you do is gonna come with a challenge  
Every bitch you fuck is gonna come with a balance (What?)  
Every shooter with me is coming in silence (What?)  
And you niggas better pick a side (Better pick a side), you niggas side hoppers (You niggas side hoppers)  
If I want 'em to not let you come into the city, it's my option (Bow)  
This is the home of the fly Shaka (Yeah)  
This where the bitches gon' watch pockets (Yeah)  
When I'm on TV, I gotta look good, 'cause I know the whole block watchin'  
We chill with the [[opp|opps]], we is not violent  
If I see 'em in person, we Fox 5 'em  
Yeah, the police was on us, we not stoppin'  
(Yeah, the police was on us, we not stoppin', no)  
This is the turn of the big drip (Big drip), smooth talk (Smooth talk, ha)  
Milly Rock (Milly Rock), Shmoney Dance (Shmoney Dance), Woo Walk (Woo)  
You will not survive being too soft (No)  
Been a long time, we took a new law (No)  
Shooters shoot so we got a new cause (Bow)  
If we stuck then we lettin' it cool off (Bow, boom)  

## [Chorus: Alicia Keys]

New York City, please go easy on me tonight  
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine  
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another  
New York City, please go easy on me  

## [Verse 3: Kanye West & _Playboi Carti_]

We went [[4. Off the Grid|off the grid]] (What?)  
We ain't [[Watch The Trone|watch the throne]], we took it  
We went viral on 'em, they lookin'  
It's a Sunday Service in Brooklyn (What?)  
It's the city that come with the lights  
I'm with the drillers that come with the night  
They ain't do four years in college, but they'll do twenty five to life  
We make money every night (What?)  
Never too big of a price (What?)  
After I buy the [[Chicago]] Bulls (What?), I'ma go link with Mike (What?)  
And if I let 'em have my wife, niggas should thank me  
With this Balenciaga and Balenci' boots and a new blue Yankee  
This is Ye, I'm so focused, throw on a mask, no COVID  
I'ma turn your life to a meme, let Justin LaBoy post it  
You got an album, postpone it  
I drop two and they both going  
I got a feeling they in they feelings  
They filmin' a show, but won't show it  
You gotta watch me in slow motion, I'm in a wide-body [[Benz]]  
I go back to college, do an album and then [[The College Dropout|drop out]] again  
It took a minute to get here, my [[She saw the vision|vision]] is crystal clear  
Ayy, Fivi', excuse me, but this the feature of the year  
I feel like Sinatra in these streets, me and Drizzy, we at peace  
This the [[backpack]] with the [[Pink Polo|Polo]] and the first [[Jesus piece]]  
I'm from the [[Chicago|Chi]]' but I'm always New York  
The city that treat me like [[7. Jesus Walks|Jesus is walkin]]'  
I been through the pain and all of the torment  
I'm sayin' His name, I make it important (What?)  
Now it's time to give 'em hell  
Ask my staff, I pay 'em well  
This afternoon, a hundred goons pullin' up to [[SNL]] (What?)  
When I pull up, it's dead on arrival  
They act like they love you, they don't even like you  
They throw a party, won't even invite you  
I seen the same thing happen to Michael  
You black and you rich, they sayin' you psycho (What?), it's like a cycle  
If you text me anything hype you better text back and say it's a typo  
The city of Gods, no city is like you  
This the new New York, Ye is the goat  
Fivi' is viral and this is the B.I.B.L.E (What?)  

## [Chorus: Alicia Keys & _Playboi Carti_]

New York City, please go easy on me tonight (What the fuck?, the fuck?)  
(What, the fuck?) New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine  
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another  
New York City, please go easy on me  

## [Outro: Alicia Keys]

Don't leave me, go easy, go easy, go easy  
Don't leave me, go easy, go easy, go easy  
Don't leave me, go easy, go easy, go easy  
New York City, please go easy on me
