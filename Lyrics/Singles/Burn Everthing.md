[Spoken: Dave Chapelle]  
(laughs)  
I denounce anti-semitism in all it’s forms (laughs)  
and i stand with my friends in the Jewish community  
and that, Kanye is how you buy yourself some time  
(laughs)  

[Verse 1: Kanye West]  
Oh, [[9. BURN|burn]] everything, light gasoline  
Oh, [[9. BURN|burn]] everything, light gasoline  
Oh, like gasoline  
Wife got Céline  
That's not my thing  
We got those tings, oh, I just can’t change  
[[9. BURN|Burn]] everything, oh, [[9. BURN|burn]] everything

[Chorus: Sean Leon]  
Storm look like lightning when I shine (Legend, legend)  
They gon' know my name before I die (Legend, legend, legendary)

[Verse 2: Sean Leon]  
Glory in my eyes, this is the story of my life  
And you'll be sorry that you tried me  
You’ll be sorry that you lied, yeah, you'll be sorry  
I pour up 40 for the guys, this for my brodies in the skies  
And not these phonies in disguise, they tellin' stories  
Yeah, they tellin' stories, tellin' lies  
'Cause the fact is I'm right, so the [[18. Facts (Charlie Heat Version)|facts]] they don't like  
Uh, they tellin’ stories, tellin’ lies  
Tryna censor my light but I'm blessed, I’m alright

[Chorus: Sean Leon]  
Storm look like lightning when I shine (Legend, legend)  
They gon' know my name before I die (Legend, legend, legendary)  
Storm look like lightning when I shine (Legend, legend)  
They gon' know my name before I die (Legend, legend, legendary)

[Verse 3: Sean Leon]  
Yeah, ayy, I'm a legend, when I step in  
Ego trippin’, ego deafin'  
This is destined  
This is god flow, this is heaven  
This that 777  
This that flow from my transgressions  
Second guessin' every second  
Each and every session feel like sex in armageddon  
This my new obsession, 'cause this bitch in my possession  
What's in my direction, just these mills in my expression  
Baby, I'm your best friend, not your boyfriend, that's a dead end  
Didn't you learn your lesson from your last man? Shit depressing  
Didn't I tell you last time, I'm a motherfu*kin'—

[Kanye West]  
Legend  
(They gon' know my name before I die)  
[[9. BURN|Burn]] everything  
(Storm look like lightning when I shine)  
Legend, like gasoline  
(They gon' know my name before I die)  
[[9. BURN|Burn]] everything  
(Storm look like lightning when I shine)  
Oh, [[9. BURN|burn]] everything  
I just can't change  
(Storm look like lightning when I shine)  
[[9. BURN|Burn]] everything  
(They gon' know my name before I die  
They gon' know my name before I die)  
[[9. BURN|Burn]] everything
