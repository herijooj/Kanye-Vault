# Nah Nah Nah (Remix) (feat. DaBaby & 2 Chainz)

Nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah  
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye  
Nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah  
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye  
(Incoming)  

Let me get 'em Ye  
They gon' hate on a young n… anyway  
They only call me when they havin' bills to pay (Go)  
Ain't nobody ask me how I feel today  
I think about it and get in my feelings, Ye  
Wanna use me, they think I'm stupid  
… that they put out is very confusin'  
Feel like the media tryna abuse me  
Y'all wanna crucify me, huh? (Oh yeah)  
She a God-fearing woman, but back that *** up  
Juvenile in '99, now I'm tryna find peace, have to find a God  
Ain't been havin' good sleep since my father died  
Know our feelings are focused, I thought you know this  
When there's prophets and m…n' poets  
You ain't got the mind to picture what my flow is  
I'm straight from the bottom… where the floor is  
Went straight through the roof, like a n… forgot where the door is (The roof)  
Tryna make some shoes with YEEZY and Billion Dollar Baby clothing  
They think 'cause we black, then we supposed to hide our feelings and it's over  
Nah … that  
She let me … after church on a Tuesday  
Don't got a ring, but she gave me that …  
Don't know how to make secular music  
I hope Ye like it, I hope he still use it  
I ain't …n' with n…, I'm Gucci  
They crumble in controversy, I be coolin' (Huh, huh)  
Your chest beatin', lemme feel your heart  
They might say I didn't, but I did my part  
I never gave a … how n… feel  
And this damn sure ain't the day I'm finna start  
Ye sent the beat that I could pick apart  
Right now in this song, we at the minute mark  
I walk down for a minute long  
Put the top down, know I'm strapped with that Glizzy  
Ain't even mean to go get in my feelings  
This is a powerful song, I can feel it  
She don't got on drawers but she know all the scriptures  
He could teach me the word, I'll never forget it  
Forgive me and her, it's a time for repentin'  
And it clap like, "Amen," from the back when I hit it  
I'm black, I'm so black, I'm so black they can feel it  
[[3. PAID|Paid]] three million cash in my taxes on Wednesday  
The government I'm payin' them millions to  
They don't care about niggas when white people kill 'em  

Boy, we wasn't never no joke, nah, nah, nah  
Say I got the same flow, ha, ha, ha  
Like they say in New York, nigga, "Ah, ah, ah"  
And everybody judgin' me, y'all not God  
Overthrow, send the drones in  
All the maneuvers, feelin' closed in  
I don't need to strike back, I let God fight my battles  
Ain't strapped with a TEC, laid it down, now where they at? (Uh)  

If one more person call me and ask me, "What's wrong with Ye?"  
That's a grown man, I can't tell him what he can and can't say  
Never been a Yes Man, so I don't feel like I have to explain  
F y'all n… ex-drug dealer, ex-ball player, X Games (Uh)  
Goin' down like Aspen, diamonds in the watch like Aspirin (Uh)  
From the clay like Cassius, ride the beat, the seat-belt fastened (Uh)  
Nah, nah, nah, nah, Johnny Gill, my, my, my (Tell 'em)  
Use a diamond chain for a tie, had a connect before Wi-Fi (Woo)  
Keep her on her toes, ballet ('Let), gotta stick to Cali (True)  
Hard to park this in valet (True), if you ain't first, you last place (Last)  
Ain't tryna brag but I'm straight (Straight)  
I caught a case 'fore I caught a cold  
This a Rolls Royce, I don't drag race  
If rap don't work, I'll buy a stove  
If rap don't work, I'll buy a scale  
Make 'em nervous, start bitin' nails  
Served 'em folks upstairs and downstairs, clientele on clientele  
Spend a thirty in YSL, shawty thick, she a Clydesdale  
I'm at Esco, double park in front of the firehouse and I'm fire as hell (Uh)  

Boy, we wasn't never no joke, nah, nah, nah (Yeah)  
All summer, murder he wrote, nah, nah, nah  
Who they talkin' 'bout? Nah, nah, nah (Yeah)  
Doin' everythin' they didn't allow, nah, nah  
Overthrow, send the drones in  
All the maneuvers, feelin' closed in  
I don't need to strike back, I let God fight my battles  
Ain't strapped with a TEC, laid it down, now where they at?
