# True Love (feat. XXXTENTACION)

_[XXXTENTACION:]_  
True love shouldn't be this complicated  
I [[Thought I'd die in your arms]], I thought I'd die in your—  
True love shouldn't be this complicated  
I [[Thought I'd die in your arms]], I thought I'd die in your—  

_[Kanye West:]_  
No hard feelings, but these feelings harder  
No-no hard feelings, but these feelings harder  
No-no hard feelings, but these feelings harder  

Wait, when you see the kids? I'll see y'all tomorrow  
Wait, when the sun set? I see y'all tomorrow  
Wait, when I pick 'em up, I feel like they borrowed  
When I gotta return them, scan 'em like a bar code  
Wait, no hard feelings, but these feelings hard though  
Wait, who got the kids in those "What are those?"  
Wait, why they can't wear Yeezys with the cargos?  
Y'all know Nike don't like me, y'all take it too far, though  
At least have 'em in some Mike's, he played for Chicago  
I only see three kids, who watchin' Chicago?  
And you know all the nannies they're Danny Nesbrasco  
Let the kids dig a tunnel to my house like Chapo  
Only neighbor in the hood with a door they can knock on  
I leave the light on  

_[XXXTENTACION (Kanye West):]_  
True love shouldn't be this complicated  
(Daddy's not gone, you see the light on)  
I [[Thought I'd die in your arms]], I thought I'd die in your—  
(Daddy's at home, tell Gekyume)  
True love shouldn't be this complicated  
(Daddy's not gone, tell Gekyume)  
I [[Thought I'd die in your arms]], I thought I'd die in your—  
(Daddy's at home)  

_[XXXTENTACION:]_  
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah  
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah (Love)  
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah  
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah  

_[Kanye West:]_  
No hard feelings, but these feelings harder  
No-no hard feelings, but these feelings harder  
No hard feelings, but these feelings harder  

_[XXXTENTACION:]_  
True love shouldn't be this complicated  
I [[Thought I'd die in your arms]], I thought I'd die in your—  
True love shouldn't be this complicated  
I [[Thought I'd die in your arms]], I thought I'd die in your—
