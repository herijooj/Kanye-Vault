# 47th Annual Grammy Speech

[Kanye West]  
Y'all might as well get the music ready because this finna' take a while  
Umm, When I had my [[19. Through the Wire|accident]] I found out at that moment nothing in life is promised except death, If you had the opportunity to play this game of life  
you need to appreciate every moment  
a lot of people don't appreciate their moment until it's passed

[Crowd applauds]  

[Kanye West]  
And then, you got to tell those Al Bundy stories "You remember when I?"  
But, Right now is my time and my moment thanks to the fans, thanks to the accident, thanks to god, thanks to Roc-A-Fella, Jay-Z, Dame Dash, G, my mother, Rhymefest everyone that's helped me  
And I plan to celebrate, I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champagne every chance I get because i'm at the grammys baby!  

[Crowd aplauds]  

[Kanye West]  
I know everybody's asking the question, they wanted know "I know he's going to wild out, I know he's going to do something crazy"  
Everbody wanted to know what I would do if I didn't win.  

[Moment of silence]
