# I Love It (feat. Adele Givens)

_[Adele Givens:]_  
'Cause you know in the old days  
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say  
They had to fake orgasms and shit  
We can tell niggas today: "Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka"  

_[Lil Pump:]_  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (love it, love it)  
(I'ma fuck a bitch, tell her cousin)  
Your boyfriend is a dork, McLovin (dork, McLovin, oohâ€¦)  

I just pulled up in a Ghost (Ghost)  
Fucked that bitch up out in London (up out in)  
Then I fucked up on her cousin  
Or her sister, I don't know nothin' (uh-uh, woo)  
And my niggas gettin' ignorant  
Like a lighter, bitch, we ignant (ignant, yeah)  
All this [[7. Water|water]] on my neck  
Look like I fell when I went fishin' (fell)  
So much diamonds on my bust down  
Ooh, fuck, what's the time? (where we at?)  
Me and Smokepurpp sippin' drank (Purpp!)  
Ooh, fuck, she take lines (lines)  

_[Lil Pump & Kanye West:]_  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it, scoop!)  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
You're such a fuckin' ho  
When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?  
Why you try to act like you was drinkin' sparklin' [[7. Water|water]] 'fore you came out here?  
You're such a fuckin' h..  

I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)  
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)  
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)  
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)  

I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck  
I like my dick sucked, I'll buy you a sick truck  
I'll buy you some new tits, I'll get you that nip-tuck  
How you start a family? The condom slipped up  
I'm a sick fuck, I'm inappropriate  
I like hearin' stories, I like that ho shit  
I wanna hear more shit, I like the ho shit  
Send me some more shit, you triflin' ho bitch (bitch, bitch, bitch)  

_[Lil Pump:]_  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
