# I Love It (feat. Adele Givens)

_[Adele Givens:]_  
'Cause you know in the old days  
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say  
They had to fake orgasms and shit  
We can tell niggas today: "Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka"  

_[Lil Pump:]_  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (love it, love it)  
(I'ma fuck a bitch, tell her cousin)  
Your boyfriend is a dork, McLovin (dork, McLovin, ooh…)  

I just pulled up in a Ghost (Ghost)  
Fucked that bitch up out in London (up out in)  
Then I fucked up on her cousin  
Or her sister, I don't know nothin' (uh-uh, woo)  
And my niggas gettin' ignorant  
Like a lighter, bitch, we ignant (ignant, yeah)  
All this water on my neck  
Look like I fell when I went fishin' (fell)  
So much diamonds on my bust down  
Ooh, fuck, what's the time? (where we at?)  
Me and Smokepurpp sippin' drank (Purpp!)  
Ooh, fuck, she take lines (lines)  

_[Lil Pump & Kanye West:]_  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it, scoop!)  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
You're such a fuckin' ho  
When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?  
Why you try to act like you was drinkin' sparklin' water 'fore you came out here?  
You're such a fuckin' h..  

I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)  
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)  
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)  
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)  

I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck  
I like my dick sucked, I'll buy you a sick truck  
I'll buy you some new tits, I'll get you that nip-tuck  
How you start a family? The condom slipped up  
I'm a sick fuck, I'm inappropriate  
I like hearin' stories, I like that ho shit  
I wanna hear more shit, I like the ho shit  
Send me some more shit, you triflin' ho bitch (bitch, bitch, bitch)  

_[Lil Pump:]_  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)  
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
