# FourFiveSeconds (with Rihanna & Paul McCartney)

_[Verse 1 - Rihanna:]_  
I think I've had enough  
I might get a little drunk  
I say what's on my mind  
I might do a little time  
Cause all of my kindness  
Is taken for weakness  

_[Hook - Rihanna:]_  
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'  
And we got three more days 'til Friday  
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'  
I swear I wish somebody would tell me  
Ooh, that's all I want  

_[Verse 2 - Kanye West:]_  
Woke up an optimist  
Sun was shinin', I'm positive  
Then I heard you was talkin' trash  
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to [[spaz]]  

_[Hook - Rihanna and Kanye West:]_  
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'  
And we got three more days 'til Friday  
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'  
I swear I wish somebody would tell me  
Ooh, that's all I want  

_[Bridge - Rihanna:]_  
And I know that you're up tonight  
Thinkin', "how could I be so selfish?"  
But you called 'bout a thousand times  
Wondering where I've been  
Now I know that you're up tonight  
Thinkin' "how could I be so reckless?"  
But I just can't apologize  
I hope you can understand  

_[Verse 3 - Kanye West:]_  
If I go to [[2. Jail|jail]] tonight  
Promise you'll pay my bail  
See they want to buy my [[pride]]  
But that just ain't up for sale  
See all of my kindness  
Is taken for weakness  

_[Hook x2 - Rihanna and Kanye West:]_  
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'  
And we got three more days 'til Friday  
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'  
I swear I wish somebody would tell me  
Ooh, that's all I want
