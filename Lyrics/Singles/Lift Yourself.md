# Lift Yourself

_[Amnesty:]_  
Hard to see, ooh  
The hang ups we have today-ay-ay  
Said we need to strive for more liberty  
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Yourself up on your feet, let's get it on  
Hard to see, ooh  
The hang ups we have today-ay-ay  
Said we need to strive for more liberty  
Lift yourself up on your feet  
Yourself up on your feet  
Lift yourself up on your feet  
Yourself up on your  
Lift  

Lift your, lift your, lift yourself  
Lift, lift your, lift your, lift your, lift your, lift, lift  

_[Kanye West (Amnesty):]_  
(Hard to see, ooh)  
(The hang ups we have today-ay-ay)  
But they don't really realize, though  
(Said we need to strive for more liberty)  
This next verse, this next verse though  
(Lift yourself up on your feet)  
These bars  
(Lift yourself up on your feet)  
Watch this some shit, go
