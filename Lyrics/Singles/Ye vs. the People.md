# Ye Vs. the People (feat. T.I.)

_[Four Tops:]_  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
I had for us  
Turned my dreams into dust  
I watch a phone that, I had for us  
Turned my dreams into dust  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I know Obama was Heaven-sent  
[[But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be President]]  
_[T.I.:]_  
Yeah you can, at what cost though?  
Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?  
_[Kanye West:]_  
Yo T.I.P., I hear your side and everybody talk though  
But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?  
_[T.I.:]_  
Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?  
It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against  
_[Kanye West:]_  
You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print  
You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit  
_[T.I.:]_  
It's bigger than your selfish agenda  
If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas, then shitâ€¦  
_[Kanye West:]_  
Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people  
Actually wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal  
_[T.I.:]_  
You gotta see the vantage point of the people  
What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil  
_[Kanye West:]_  
See that's the problem with this damn nation  
All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man, we ain't made it off the plantation  
_[T.I.:]_  
Fuck who you choose as your political party  
You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted  
With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position  
Don't you feel an obligation to them?  
_[Kanye West:]_  
I feel an obligation to show people new ideas  
And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here  
Make America Great Again had a negative reception  
I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction  
Added empathy, care and love and affection  
And y'all simply questionin' my methods  
_[T.I.:]_  
What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?  
This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you  
You wore a dusty ass hat to represent the same views  
As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you  
All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie  
Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie  
That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now  
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down  
_[Kanye West:]_  
You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?  
I mean, that hat stayed in my closet about a year and a half  
Then one day I was like, "Fuck it, I'ma do me"  
I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me  
Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up  
Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up  
_[T.I.:]_  
The greater good of the people is first  
Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?  
You had a bad idea, and you're makin' it worse  
This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church  
_[Kanye West:]_  
Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different  
Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand  
I know everybody emotional  
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?  
Or how about I'ma shoot you, or fuck your bitch?  
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich  
_[T.I.:]_  
You'll deal with God for the lack of respect  
Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check  
Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that  
What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?  
Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bitch  
Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget  
All that free thought shit, find a better defense  
_[Kanye West:]_  
But if Ye's just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that  
Fuck it  

Alright T.I.P., we could be rappin' about this all day, man, why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?
