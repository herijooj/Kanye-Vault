# White Dress (from "The Man With The Iron Fists" soundtrack)

Just me and you, girl  
Wooooaah ohhh  
Just me and you, girl  
Wooooaah ohhh  

Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment  
Aren't you a sight for red eyes?  
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side  
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up  
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up  

Just me and you, girl  
Wooooaah ohhh  
Just me and you, girl  
Wooooaah ohhh  

We had problems but it's all in the past  
[[Everybody got problems, baby, algebra class]]  
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh  
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass?  
You like pi√±a coladas, getting caught in the rain  
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain  
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains  
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name  
But, they never let us do our thing  
Everybody lying on who I bang  
We was on fire but they blew our flame  
Ain't no denying, baby, you have changed  
'Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten  
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping  
'Cause even when we're kissing, baby girl feel different  
Friends all diss him like, "No he didn't?  
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?  
Is that bitch still stripping?  
Trying to get a pair of [[She spent her whole check on some Christians|Christians]]?"  
I swear to God that they got you going crazy  
But you play it off and say, "How is work, baby?"  
Well, some of the models is too coked up to walk straight  
But seem to still love the man that they all hate  
But babe, I call you back and say that you say that always  
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait  
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time  
And my [[Debt|credit's so bad]] I can't get no one to cosign  
I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'  
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign  
Now, she back in the club in a tight dress  
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress  
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd  
Talk to a nigga with a ten year ago swag  
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends  
Quote unquote, "'Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends"  
On the phone, hollin' that "Niggas is whatever"  
Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever  
Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home  
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone  
[[I'm tryin' to right my wrongs|I accept that I was wrong]], except a nigga grown  
So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned  
So a nigga had to hop on a plane  
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain  
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candle light dinner  
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her  
And told her, "Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress  
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress"  
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine  
Just to make up for all the years and the pain  
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came  
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no, that's a shame  
Wedding in June, what could be better?  
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever  
Take the very last car of the Eurostar  
Tell the conductor, "Just drive so far"  
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited  
Well, we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited  
We will not be disturbed by the fussing and fighting  
Tell Peaches light the herb 'cause we just reunited  
Let's make a move from these herbs, go somewhere in private  
I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot, uh   ^c944f6

Just me and you, girl  
Wooooaah ohhh  
Just me and you, girl  
Wooooaah ohhh
