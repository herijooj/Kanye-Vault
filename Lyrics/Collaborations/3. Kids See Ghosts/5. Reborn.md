# Reborn

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Very rarely do you catch me out  
Ya'll done "specially invited guest"'d me out  
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out  
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"  
I was, off the chain, I was often drained  
I was off the meds, I was called insane  
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame  
I want all the rain, I want all the pain  
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame  
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain  
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained  
All of you Mario, it's all a game  

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  

I had my issues, ain't that much I could do  
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me, with me  
At times, wonder my purpose  
Easy then to feel worthless  
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me, with me)  
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go  
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me  
Had me feelin' oh so low  
Ain't no stoppin' you no way  
All things, the night before  
Ain't no stoppin' you no way  
No stress yes, I'm so blessed andI'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  

Movin' forward, movin' forward, movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward (somethin's wrong)  
Keep movin' forward (I don't know why)  
Keep movin' forward (so long)  
Keep movin' forward (sit here in [[the storm]])  
Keep movin' forward (time goes on)  
Keep movin' forward (been lookin' for my way out)  
Keep movin' forward (from [[the storm]])  
Keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)  

I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)  
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward  
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward  
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
