# Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)

_[Marcus Garvey:]_  
May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?  
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation  
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I don't feel pain anymore  
Guess what, baby? I feel freeee (scoop!)  
Nothin' hurts me anymore  
Guess what, baby? I feel freeee  

_[Kid Cudi:]_

And set me freeee, yeah
