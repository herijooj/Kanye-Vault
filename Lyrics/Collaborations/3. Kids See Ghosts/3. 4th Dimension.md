# 4th Dimension (feat. Louis Prima)

_[Louis Prima:]_  
"Down the chimney, he will come  
With his great big smile  
And you'll find that even the kiddies  
Are swingin' in the latest style  
Oh, oh, oh  
What is Santa bringing?  
Oh, oh, oh  
[[4. I Wonder|I wonder]] whether he'll be swingin'"  

_[Kanye West:]_  
It feels so good, it should cost  
Bought an alligator, I ain't talkin' Lacoste  
Made me say, "Ooh, uh"  
Like I'm mixing Master P and Rick Ross (uh, uh)  
She seem to make me always feel like a boss (uh, uh)  
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost (uh, uh)  
She said I'm goin' too fast, I'm exhausted  
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'  
This the theme song, oh somethin' wrong  
Might need an intervention for this new dimension  
That's too new to mention, or fit in a sentence  
If I get locked up, I won't finish the sent—  

_[Louis Prima:]_  
"Oh, oh, oh  
What is Santa bringin'?  
Oh, oh, oh  
[[4. I Wonder|I wonder]] whether he'll be swingin'"  

_[_laughter_]_  

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
Gettin' loose while I'm on the deuce, see me roll out  
What you surf, hit the coast, and this feelin', I got  
Plenty of adventures for the evenin', we go journey, we off  
From the light to guide us home, we in the moment, oh-oh  
Such a lost boy, caught up in the darkest I had  
What's the cost, boy? Losin' everything that I had  
She been on me, boy, unless you got somethin' to tell  
Sittin', waitin' for me slippin', yeah, I'll see you in hell  
Tell the cougar get up off me, no, my soul ain't for sale  
All the evils in the world, they keepin' on me for real  
I really hope the Lord won't hurt me, we all live in sin  
Kids see ghost off the ropes, Ric Flair on your bitch  
Now this the theme song, this the theme song  
The put the beams on, get your, get your dream on  
But you don't hear me though, drama: we let it go  
Watch the guitars roll and let your friends know  

_[Louis Prima:]_  
"Oh, oh, oh  
What is Santa bringin'?  
Oh, oh, oh  
[[4. I Wonder|I wonder]] whether he'll be swingin'"  

_[Shirley Anne Lee:]_  
"Just do that and then let the music do somethin', then do that again, that'd be enough for a record  
I mean, you only want two and a half minutes if you can get it, you know, three minutes max—"
