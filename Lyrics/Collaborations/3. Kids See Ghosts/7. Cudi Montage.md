# Cudi Montage

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
Find my back in the cold  
Trapped in another soul, they can hear me holler  
I'm colder than the game  
See 'em all strapped in an' can't move and I'm sinkin' lower  
Heaven gonna help me  
'Cause I feel the world weighin' on me heavy, tryna keep it steady  
Ready for the mission  
God, shine your love on me, save me, please  
If I'm goin' alone, I've been gone for so long  
Ain't nobody, you can't hear a word  
Perched in the night, lookinâ€™ out nowhere  
Where's home on this hidden earth?  
Pain in my eyes, in the time I find, I'm [[3. Stronger|stronger]] than I ever was  
Here we go again, God, shine your love on me, save me, please  

_[Mr. Hudson (Kid Cudi):]_  
(Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)

(Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)  
Stay strong  
(Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)  
Save me, Lord  
(Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)  
Stay strong

Save me, Lord  
(Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)  
Stay strong  
(Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)  
Save me, Lord  
(Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Everybody want world peace  
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece  
Then you go and buy your own piece  
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace  
Bring light to what they don't see  
Auntie cryin' on the concrete  
Talkin' to dispatcher then the phone beep  
On the other line was the homies  
Told her that you ain't comin' home, see  
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep  
Caught with the rifle with the long reach  
Just another cycle of the lonely  
All growin' up in environment  
Where doin' crime the requirement  
They send us off to prison for retirement  
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men
