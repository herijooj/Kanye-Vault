_[Chorus: Kid Cudi]_  
I can still feel the love  
I can still feel the love  
I can still feel the love  
Feel the love  

_[Pusha-T (Kid Cudi):]_  
We not worried 'bout no other niggas, we them other niggas  
You bust down a Rollie, I bust down a brick, then I flood it, nigga  
I am not to be compared to you rappers (Eazy-Duz-It) nigga  
I am more Eazy, you tryin' your best to become me, nigga  
She like them bottles with bubbles in it  
Buy her Loewe and other linen  
Why would I wait when there's other women?  
Why would I hate? We in love with winnin', ooh  
Buy her bundles, fly her out, bring her friend, I try her out  
Ain't no worries findin' out, the details is ironed out  
Easily they plays along, hopin' that I play a song  
Love to fuck to trap music (feel the love)
