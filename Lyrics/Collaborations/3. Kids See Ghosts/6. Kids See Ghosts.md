# Kids See Ghosts

_[Yasiin Bey:]_  
Kids see ghosts sometimes  
Kids see ghosts sometimes  
Kids see ghosts sometimes  
Spirit, movin' around, just movin' around  
Kids see ghosts sometimes  
Kids see ghosts sometimes  
Kids see ghosts  
Spirit, yeah, that's the [[16. KING|king]]  

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
Stop that movement, stop that movement  
Y'all can't move me, this my movie  
Y'all can't stop me, y'all too sloppy  
Carbon copied, carbon  
Same thing, in a room  
Sittin' by myself, findin' heaven soon  
Many things that will trouble you  
Look beyond for a feelin' like you never knew  
Reachin' out, huntin' for the truth  
I guessin' I'm just sick of runnin'  
All this time searchin' hard for somethin'  
I can hear the angels comin'  

Kids see ghosts sometimes  
Kids see ghosts sometimes  
Kids see ghosts sometimes  
Spirit, movin' around, just movin' around  
Kids see ghosts sometimes

_[Kanye West:]_  
Well, it took me long enough to rap on this strong enough  
[[3. PAID|Paid]] this shit just gon' give up, 'cause Ye just gon' live up  
To everything that sucks to you and that's never enough  
Thought I'd be clever enough to give up while I'm ahead  
I like breakfast in bed, but I love breakfast and head  
For anybody who said that I was better off dead  
Told 'em, "Don't ever believe nothin' that you ever read"  
Got a Bible by my bed, oh yes, I'm very Christian  
[[Constantly repentin]]', 'cause, yes, I never listen  
Don't like bein' questioned and don't like bein' less  
Than any a competition in any of my professions  
So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man  
What else you expect from, uh, Mr. West, man  
Painted from Western, space like a relative  
Bet you ain't see it, man, call on the telephone  
And when they see you they say, “Damn you got hella grown  
Always thought you'd make it, but damn now you hella known"  
Let's address some topics that I can embellish on  
How we made enough bread for us to put some relish on  
I'ma relish on the fact vibin' on the future  
Ultralight buildin' in the buildin' by Miuccia  
Herzog and De Meuron in an office out in Basel  
No not Miami, Switzerland (Switzerland, ahahaha)

Kids see ghosts  
Spirit, yeah, that's the [[16. KING|king]]  

Civilization without society  
[[3. Power|Power]] and wealth with nobility  
Stability without stasis  
Places and spaces

Kids see ghosts sometimes  
Kids see ghosts—ghosts sometimes

And what's a crown for the clouds, movin' around  
Yeah, that's the [[16. KING|king]]
