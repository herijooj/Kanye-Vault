# Gotta Have It

_[Kanye West:]_  
Turn my headphones up, louder, uh-huh, uh-huh  

_[James Brown:]_  
What you need, what–what you need  
I got what you need, what–what you need (Bam)  
What you need, what–what you need  
I got what you need  

_[Kanye West and Jay-Z:]_  
Hello, hello, hello, hello, white America, assassinate my character  
Money matrimony, yeah, they tryna break the marriage up  
Who gon' act phony, or who gon' try to embarrass ya?  
I'ma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up  
Bueller had a Muller but I switched it for a Mille  
'Cause I'm richer, and prior to this shit, was movin' free base  
Had a conference with the DJs (Yeah?), Puerto Rico three days  
Poli with the PDs, now they got our shit on replay  
Sorry I'm in pajamas but I just got off the PJ  
And last party we had, they shut down Prive  
Ain't that where the Heat play? (Yeah)  
Niggas hate ballers these days (Yeah)  
Ain't that like LeBron James?  
Ain't that just like D-Wade? Wait  

_[James Brown:]_  
What you need, what–what you need  
I got what you need, what–what you need (Bam)  
What you need, what–what you need  
I got what you need (Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam)  

_[Jay-Z and Kanye West:]_  
Wussup, wussup, wussup, wussup  
Wussup, muh'fucka? Where my money at?  
You gon' make me come down to your house where yo' mommy at  
Mummy wrap the kids, have 'em cryin' for they mommy back  
Dummy that your daddy is, tell 'em I just want my racks  
Racks on racks on racks (Racks!)  
Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs  
Who in that? Oh shit, it's just blacks on blacks on blacks  
Hunnid stack–How you get it? Nigga layin' raps on tracks  
I wish I could give you this feeling, I'm planking on a million  
I'm riding through yo' hood, you can bank I ain't got no ceiling  
Made a left on Nostrand Ave., (Right), we in Bed Stuy  
Made a right on 79th, I'm coming down South Shore Drive  
I remain [[Chicago|Chi-Town]], Brooklyn 'til I die  

_[James Brown:]_  
Take 'em on home, take 'em on home  
Take 'em on home, take 'em on home  
I got what you need, what–what you need  
Take 'em on home  
What you need, what–what you need  
I got what you need, what–what you need  
Take 'em on home, take 'em on home  
Take 'em on home, take 'em on home  
Tryna hurt my name, huh?
