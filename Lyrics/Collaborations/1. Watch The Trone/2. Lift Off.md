# Lift Off (feat. Beyonce)

_[Jack King:]_  
All engines running  

_[Beyoncé:]_  
We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars  
How many people you know can take it this far?  
I'm supercharged  
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars (Lift off)  
Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars  
We don't know what we could do to make it this far  
So many scars  
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Lift off (lift off), lift off, takin' my coat off  
Showing my tattoos, I'm such a show off, huh  
I feel the pain and then roll off  
I got the whole city, they about to go off  
How many niggas with me up and in the aisle? (Lift off)  
How many people want to roll on me now? (Lift off)  
Like you know na na na, you know me by now (Lift off)  
Know me (Lift off), know me by now  

_[Beyoncé:]_  
We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars  
How many people you know can take it this far?  
I'm supercharged  
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars (Lift off)  
Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars  
We don't know what we could do to make it this far  
So many scars  
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Lift off (Lift off), off, ah, like you know, na-na-na  
You know me by now, know me, know me by now  
You know me, know me by now, know me, know me by now  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
Lift off  
Rappers hear Watch the Throne, they gon' be pissed off  
Earth is boring to 'em, shit is making my dick soft  
When you earn hard as me, eventually you hit a big wall  
5-4, 3-2, we need fuel, lift off  

_[Beyoncé:]_  
Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars  
How many people you know can take it this far?  
I'm supercharged  
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars (All engines running)  
Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars  
We don't know what we could do to make it this far  
So many scars  
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars (Lift off)  

_[Jack King:]_  
(Lift off) 20 seconds and counting (Lift off)  
(Lift off) T minus 15 seconds, guidance is internal (Lift off)  
12, 11, 10, 9, ignition sequence start  
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, all engines running  
Lift off, we have a lift off (Lift off, lift off, lift off, lift off…)  

_[Beyoncé:]_  
Jump  
Now we gon', now we gon', now we gon', now we gon' (J-jump)  
Now we gon' take it to the moon  
Now we gon', now we gon' (J-j-jump)  
We gon' take it to the moon  
Take it to the stars (J-j-jump)  
We gon' take it to the moon  
Take it to the stars  
How many people you know can take it this far?  
Take it to the stars  
How many people you know can take it this far?  
Now we gon', now we gon', now we gon', now we gon', now
