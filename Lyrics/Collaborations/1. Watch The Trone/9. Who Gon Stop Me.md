# Who Gon Stop Me

_[Flux Pavilion:]_  
I can't stop-op-op-op  
I can't stop  

_[Kanye West and Jay-Z:]_  
This is something like the Holocaust  
Millions of our people lost  
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord  
'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball  
Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?  
Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?  
Black cards, black cars, black on black, black broads  
Whole lotta money in a black bag  
Black strap: you know what that's for  

_[Jay-Z, Kanye West:]_  
Who gon' stop me, huh?  
Who gon' stop me, huh?  
Yeah, who gon' stop me?  
No brakes, I need State Farm  
So many watches, I need eight arms  
One neck but got eight charms  
Who gon' stop me, huh?  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Niggas [[4. TALKING|talking]], they bitch-made, ix-nay off my dicks-nay  
That's Pig Latin, itch-bay; who gon' stop me, huh?  
Last night ain't go so well, got kicked up out the hotel  
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert, "Yes!" Tell Howard Cosell  
You just a commentator if you getting paper  
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters  
In some relations, you just supposed to say none  
Heard she fucked the doorman  
Well, that's cool, I fucked the waitress  
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis  
I only like green faces  

_[Kanye West and Jay-Z:]_  
This is something like the Holocaust  
Millions of our people lost  
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord  
'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball  
Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?  
Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?  
Black cards, black cars, black on black, black broads  
Whole lotta money in a black bag  
Black strap: you know what that's for  

_[Kanye West and Jay-Z:]_  
Y'all weed purple, my money purple  
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah's circle (Yeah, yeah, let's go)  
I wrote the verse that I hope will hurt you  

_[Jay-Z and Kanye West:]_  
Who gon' stop me, huh?  
Beat the odds, beat the Feds  
It wouldn't be wise to bet against the kid  
Start me broke, I bet I get rich  
Night shift: six to six  
Give me one shot, one pot  
I'll show up in all white, wearin' no socks  
No ceiling, new coupe  
They know I'm a dope boy, they don't have no proof  
I'm three steps removed, I know how to move  
It's looking like I don't know how to lose  
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn  
I'm at the table, I'm gamblin'  
Lucky lefty, I expect a seven  
I went through hell, I'm expectin' heaven  
I'm owed, 'cause I'm dough, and I stuck to the G-code  
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere  
OK, here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats  
I'm allergic to havin' bunny ears, like broke, like nope  
Like ha, I ain't no joke  
I can't be stopped, like nope, like nope  
Extend the beat, Noah (…and pray to the Lord), uh  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
Two seats in the 911, uh  
No limit on the Black Card, uh  
Told y'all I was gonna go H·A·M, uh  
'Til the ocean was my backyard, uh  
No lies in my verses, hey  
Please pardon all the curses, hey  
Shit gotta come in some way, fuck  
When you're growing up worthless, uh  
Middle finger to my old life, uh  
Special shout-out to my old head, uh  
If it wasn't for your advice, uh  
A nigga would have been so dead, uh  
I'm living life 'til these niggas kill me  
Turn this up if you niggas feel me  
I'm riding dirty, tryna get filthy  
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes  
Graduated to the MoMA  
And I did all of this without a diploma  
Graduated from the corner  
Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna  
Street-smart and I'm book-smart  
Coulda been a chemist 'cause I cook smart  
Only thing that can stop me is me, hey  
And I'ma stop when the hook start, hol' up

Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
