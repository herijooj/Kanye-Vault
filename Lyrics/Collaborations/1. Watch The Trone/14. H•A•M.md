# H•A•M

_[Kanye West:]_  
It was all good just a week ago, niggas feel theyself  
And that Watch the Throne drop, niggas kill theyself  
What niggas gon' do, Hov?  
This the new crack, on a new stove  
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas telling me, "You back!"  
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?  
And if life's a bitch, bet she suck my dick, huh  
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh  
By the way, nigga, you should fucking quit, nigga  
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it  
Like Eli, I did it, joke's on you, motherfucker, and I get it, ha ha  
No paper, ho, but you can have some more of me  
Or-a-gy or are we speaking metaphorically?  
Historically I'm kicking bitches out like Pam, nigga  
Going HAM, nigga; me and Jigga  
And a nigga still young, why I have no kids  
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit  
Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit  
But the head's so good, damn, a nigga glad he hit  
Got 'em jumping out the building, watch out below  
A million out the door  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I'm about to go HAM  
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am  
I'm about to go HAM  
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
Fuck y'all mad at me for?  
Y'all don't even know what I've been through  
I played chicken with a Mack truck  
Y'all motherfuckers woulda been moved  
I swam waters with Great Whites  
Y'all motherfuckers woulda been chewed  
I hustled with [[vultures]] late nights  
Y'all motherfuckers woulda been food  
Fuck wrong with these dudes? Try to walk around in these shoes  
See the shit I saw growing up  
Then maybe you could take a peek at these boos  
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily  
Like these rappers rap about all the shit that I do really  
I'm like, "Really; half a billi,' nigga, really?" You got baby money  
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady's money  
Watch the throne, don't step on our robe  
Bad enough we let you step on our globe  
With my nephew die, daddy's dead  
Nigga took the price on my uncle's head  
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled  
So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread  
Bow down, brother, pay homage  
Don't spill hate all on my garments  
Comme des Garçons, fuck yo' fresh  
Head shots, nigga, fuck your vest  
Fuck the pigs, no pork on my fork  
Peace, God, 'cause you know a nigga just went  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
HAM  
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am  
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go HAM  
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am  
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go HAM
