# Why I Love You (feat. Mr. Hudson)

_[Mr. Hudson:]_  
Ooooh, I love you so  
But why I love you, I'll never know  
(Ooooh, I love you so  
But why I love you, I'll never know)  
Ooooh, I love you so  
But why I love you, I'll never know  
(Ooooh, I love you so  
But why I love you, I'll never know)  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
Picture, if you will, that the throne's burning  
Rome's burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone, burning  
Why does it always end up like this?  
Something that we don't determine  
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for  
That I live for, that I die for  
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for  
And they want me dead, but I'm sorry, but I just can't die for you  
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you  
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th  
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?  
When the grief is over, beef is over  
I'll be fly when Easter's over  
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings  
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers  
So when love is gone 'til blood is drawn  
'Cause we no longer wear the same uniform  
Fuck you, squares, the circle got smaller  
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller  
And truth be told, after all that said  
Niggas still got love for you  

_[Mr. Hudson:]_  
Ooooh, I love you so  
But why I love you, I'll never know  
(Ooooh, I love you so  
But why I love you, I'll never know)  
Ooooh, I love you so  
But why I love you, I'll never know  
(Ooooh, I love you so  
But why I love you, I'll never know)  

_[Jay-Z and Kanye West:]_  
Showed love to you niggas  
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it  
I picked up the pieces 'fore you swept on it  
Goddamn, this shit leaves a mess, don't it?  
Shit feelin' like death, don't it?  
Charge it to the game, whatever's left on it  
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it  
Fly, pelican, fly, turn the jets on it  
But first I shall digress on it  
Wasn't I a good king?  
Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?  
Didn't I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?  
Huh, I gave you my loyalty  
Made you royalty and royalties  
Took care of these niggas' lawyer fees  
And this is how niggas rewarded me, damn  

_[Mr. Hudson:]_  
Ooooh, I love you so  
But why I love you, I'll never know  
(Ooooh, I love you so  
But why I love you, I'll never know)  

_[Jay-Z and Kanye West:]_  
Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me  
But I'm bulletproof, bitch, you can't get nothin' past me  
Got body armor  
A nigga gotta watch the throne  
And I'm bussin' back  
So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones  
What do you do when the love turns to hate?  
Gotta separate from these fuckin' fakes  
Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist  
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit  
Am I my brother's keeper?  
Only if that nigga don't creep up  
Got a pistol under my pillow  
I've never been a deep sleeper  
P-p-p-paranoia, 'cause the nigga that said he'll  
Blast for ya is now blastin' for ya  
That's an assassin for ya  
These niggas got a shot, they'll shoot  
Please Lord, forgive him  
For these niggas not know what they do, ooh
