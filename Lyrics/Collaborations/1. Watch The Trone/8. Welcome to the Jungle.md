# Welcome to the Jungle (feat. Swizz Beatz)

_[Swizz Beatz and Jay-Z:]_  
Uh, right, oh, oh  
Right (Yeah), one-two, one-two, ay  

_[Swizz Beatz, Kanye West and Jay-Z:]_  
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well  
(Yeah, yeah)  
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well  
(Yeah, uh, yeah)  
I asked her where she wanna be when she 25 (Five)  
She turned around and looked at me and said "Alive"  
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well  
(Uh, oh)  

_[Jay-Z and Swizz Beatz:]_  
Black Axl Rose, move halves and wholes (Right)  
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov (Right)  
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears (Oh)  
Work pots and pans (Goddammit), just to cop me some Airs  
My uncle died, my daddy did too (Ay)  
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move  
My nephew gone, my heart is torn  
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born  
My faith in God, every day is hard  
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard  

_[Kanye West and Jay-Z:]_  
Why I pray so hard, this is crazy God  
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all  
So que será (Welcome to the jungle), get a case of Syrah  
Let it chase the pain, 'fore it goes too far  

_[Jay-Z and Kanye West:]_  
Yeah, my dreams is big, reality set in (Huh)  
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon (Yeah)  
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas  
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it  
I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise  
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5 (Ooh, woo)  
I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin'  
I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending (Yeah)  
Where the fuck is the sun? It's been a while  
Momma, look at ya son, what happened to my smile?  
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket  
I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it  
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low  
Goddamn, I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?  
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment  
I look in the mirror, my only opponent  
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?  
Either they know or don't care, I'm fucking depressed  
No crying in public, just lying to judges  
Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it, well  

_[Swizz Beatz:]_  
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well  
Goddammit
