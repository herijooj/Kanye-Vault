# The Joy (feat. Curtis Mayfield)

_[Curtis Mayfield, Pete Rock and Charlie Wilson:]_  
Add a little sugar (Ow!), honeysuckle and (Woo!)  
A great big expression of happiness  
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh-huh; uh-huh) with a dozen [[9. Roses|roses]]  
(Ay, uh; Mr. West) Such would astound you  
(Pete Rock) The joy of children laughing around you  
(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Woo!)  

_[Kanye West and Pete Rock:]_  
I [[7. DO IT|do it]] for the forefathers, yeah, the street authors  
That are now A&Rs in the cheap office  
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers  
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us  
Gave her a handshake, only for my man's sake  
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake  
Now there's crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)  
And she want me to cum all over her damn face  
I never understood Planned Parenthood  
'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood  
Taking refills of that Plan B pill  
Another [[Shorty]] that won't make it to the family will  
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will  
They ain't crazy, they don't know how insanity feel  
Don C. just had a [[Shorty]], so it's not that bad  
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had  

_[Curtis Mayfield, Pete Rock and Charlie Wilson:]_  
Add a little sugar (Woo!), honeysuckle and (Come on)  
A great big expression of happiness (Ow!)  
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh-huh; uh) with a dozen [[9. Roses|roses]]  
(Kanye; ay, uh) Such would astound you  
(Pete Rock) The joy of children laughing around you  
(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Yeah)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
No electro, no metro, a little retro, ah, perfecto  
You know the demo, your boy act wild  
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy's back in style  
Now one room got Gidget—the other got Bridget  
What's more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters  
Nah, you ain't listen; they black—they sistas  
They mama named 'em after white bitches  
So next time you see me on your Fallopian  
Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian  
Stupid questions like, "Is he gon' be dope again?  
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"  
This beat deserves [[Hennessy|Hennessy]]  
A bad bitch, and a bag of weed: the Holy Trinity  
In the mirror where I see my only enemy  
Your life's cursed? Well, mine's an obscenity  

_[Curtis Mayfield, Pete Rock, Charlie Wilson and Jay-Z:]_  
Add a little sugar (Woo!), honeysuckle and (Come on; red lights)  
A great big expression of happiness (Ow!)  
Boy, you couldn't miss (Let that thing roll; uh-huh; uh) with a dozen [[9. Roses|roses]]  
(Kanye; Ay, uh) Such would astound you  
(Pete Rock; uh) The joy of children laughing around you  
(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Yeah)  
(Ow!)  

_[Jay-Z and Pete Rock:]_  
This is my mama's shit  
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood (Uh-huh)  
When I was back in my pajama shit  
Afros and marijuana sticks (Woo!), seeds in the ganja  
Had it poppin' like the sample that I'm rhymin' with  
Pete Rock (Uh), let the needle drop  
I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don't needle pop (Uh-huh)  
Takin' sips of Pop's six-pack of Miller nips  
Pink Champale, Ballantine Ale (Woo!)  
Ballys on my feet help me balance out well  
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale  
I got it honest from the parties from my mama's  
Virgin Marys try to judge her  
I'm like, "Where are them Madonnas now?"  
Give all glory to Gloria (One-two, okay)  
They said, "You raised that boy too fast"  
But you was raising a warrior (One-two, okay)  
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us, uh  

_[Kid Cudi and Pete Rock:]_  
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (It's Pete Rock, Kanye)  
Don't let them take your fire  
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (One-two, okay)  
Don't let them take your fire  
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (It's Pete Rock, Kanye)  
Don't let them take your fire  
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now, yeah (One-two, okay)  
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay  
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay  
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay  
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay
