# Illest Motherfucker Alive

_[Kanye West:]_  
1985 white Lamborghini Countach, two of 'em  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I need a slow motion video right now  
'Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion  
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga  
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey  
I need a slow motion video right now, ay, ay  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Damn, baby, pussy can't be your only hustle  
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell  
I mean a lot of niggas got money  
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell  
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe  
Zero, zero, zero, zero, a whole lot of Os  
What you after, actor money?  
You in line behind currency, yeah, you after money  
Bulletproof condom when I'm in these hoes  
[[Got staples on my dick, why? Fuckin' centerfolds]]  
And I swear to God they so cold  
[[Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes]]  
I got my fur on, feelin' like Jerome  
She got her fur too, we get our his and her on  
Don't look at the jewelry, or get your blur on  
Too close, you comatose, so dope, you overdose  
Get back, you overclose, oh no  
The hood was strugglin' but then I blessed them with that [[Pink Polo|Polo]]  
Niggas was making music and then my first solo  
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo  
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos  
Yeah and I'm cold, bitch, please try to keep the door closed  
Lanvin thousand-dollar tee with no logos  
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed  

_[Jay Z and Kanye West:]_  
Take it how you want 'til a nigga dead  
'Til then, I'm the illest motherfucker alive  
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh  
Whole world aiming at a nigga head  
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive  
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, hol' up  

_[Jay Z:]_  
[[16. KING|King]] Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think  
Eleven in a row, Bill Russell rings  
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad  
Nigga, I got five more rings than Michael Jordan had  
Elvis has left the building, now I'm on the Beatles ass  
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah, it's like the Beatles back  
Bey-Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih-Rih complete the family  
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys  
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch  
The Roc is in the building, we should have stayed in the house  
I don't even know what we doing here  
Seems to me a complete waste of gear  
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles  
Niggas' fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models  
Got the oversized Rollie, let me show thee how to [[7. DO IT|do it]]  
When I say it then you see it, it ain't only in the music  
Basquiats, Warhols, serving as my muses  
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing  
Usually you have this much taste, you European  
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga, never again  
Know when to leave when the heat is coming, I learnt that  
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back  
Fuck Sosa, this Hova, this is real life  
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like  

_[Kanye West and Kid Cudi:]_  
I need a slow motion video right now  
'Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion  
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)  
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga  
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)  
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey  
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)  
I need a slow motion video right now  
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)  
Ay, ay  
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
