# Made in America (feat. Frank Ocean)

_[Frank Ocean:]_  
And He'll bring you out the, out the darkness  

_[Frank Ocean:]_  
Sweet [[16. KING|king]] Martin, sweet queen Coretta  
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty  
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph  
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America  
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America  
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I told my mama I was on the come up  
She said, "You going to school, I'll give you a summer"  
Then she met No I.D. and gave me his number  
Ten years later, she driving a Hummer  
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye  
What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay  
And I'm rapping on the beats they was supposed to buy  
I guess I'm getting high off my own supply  
Downtown, mixing fabrics, tryna find the magic  
Started a little blog just to get some traffic  
Old folks'll tell you not to play in traffic, uh  
A million hits and the web crashes, damn  
South Park had 'em all laughing  
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin', uh  
Ignore the critics just to say we did it  
This ain't no fashion show, motherfucker, we live it

Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America  
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
I pledge allegiance to my Grandma  
For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana  
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm and Hammer  
Straight out the kitchen, shh, don't wake Nana  
Built a republic that still stands  
I'm tryna lead a nation to leave to my little man's  
Or my daughter, so I'm boiling this [[7. Water|water]]  
The scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order  
Hold up, here comes grandma, what's up Yaya?  
What's that smell? Oh, I'm just boiling some agua  
No papa, bad Santa  
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners  
I got my liberty chopping grams up  
Street justice, I pray God understand us  
I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers  
This is the Star Spangled Banner
