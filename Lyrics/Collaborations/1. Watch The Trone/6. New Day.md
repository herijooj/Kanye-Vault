# New Day

_[Nina Simone and Kanye West:]_  
Yeah, uh  
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel  
Me and the RZA connect  
Breeze driftin' on by  
Yeah, me and the RZA connect  
Breeze driftin' on by (Uh)  
It's a new life for me, yeah  
It's a new dawn, it's a new day  
It's a new life for me, ooh (Uh)  
And I'm feeling good  
Yeah, uh  

_[Kanye West:]_  
And I'll never let my son have an ego  
He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go  
I mean, I might even make him be Republican  
So everybody know he love white people  
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend  
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind  
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon  
I mean, even if people dyin' and the world ends  
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life  
Just want him to be someone people like  
Don't want him to be hated all the time, judged  
Don't be like your daddy that'd never budge  
And I'll never let him ever hit a strip club  
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love  
And I'll never let his mom move to LA  
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure now we all pray  

_[Nina Simone and Jay-Z:]_  
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel  
Breeze driftin' on by  
Breeze driftin' on by  
Me and the RZA connect  
It's a new life for me, ooh  
Me and the RZA connect  
And I'm feeling good  
Yeah  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
Sorry, junior, I already ruined ya  
'Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya  
Sins of a father make your life ten times harder  
I just wanna take ya to a barber  
Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did  
Teach you good values so you cherish it  
Took me 26 years to find my path  
My only job is cut the time in half  
So at 13, we'll have our first drink together  
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk  
Look a man dead in his eyes  
So he know you talk truth when you speak it  
Give your word, keep it  
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend  
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him  
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'  
'Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him  
Never repeat him, never repeat him  

_[Nina Simone:]_  
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel  
Breeze driftin' on by  
Breeze driftin' on by  
It's a new life for me, yeah  
It's a new dawn, it's a new day  
It's a new life for me, ooh  
And I'm feeling good  
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel  
Breeze driftin' on by  
Breeze driftin' on by  
It's a new life for me, yeah  
It's a new dawn, it's a new day  
It's a new life for me, ooh  
And I'm feeling  
Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel
