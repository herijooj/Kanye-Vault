# Murder to Excellence

_[I. "Murder"]_  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
Uh, bloody murder, murder, murder  
Bloody murder, murder, murder, murder  
Bloody murder, murder, murder, murder  
Bloody murder, murder, murder  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder"  
Paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder" again  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
Uh, this is to the memory of Danroy Henry  
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly  
Strays from the same shade, nigga, we on the same team  
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing, uh  
All-black everything, nigga, you know my fresh code  
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stress load  
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you  
Power to the people, when you see me, see you  

_[Kanye West:]_  
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital  
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon  
Looking at the news like, "Damn! I was just with him after school"  
No shop class, but half the school got a tool  
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude  
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue  
It's time for us to stop and redefine black power  
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours  

_[Kanye West:]_  
The paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder"  
The paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder" again  
"Murder" again  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Is it genocide?  
'Cause I can still hear his mama cries  
Know the family traumatized  
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized  
The old pastor closed the cold casket  
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs  
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from  
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go  
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in [[Chicago]]  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died  
Uh, real niggas just multiply  
And they say by 21, I was supposed to die  
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise  
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival  
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you  
What up, Blood? Uh, what up, cuz? Uh, it's all black, uh, I love us  

_[Kanye West:]_  
The paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder"  
The paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder" again  
"Black-on-black murder" again  
"Black-on-black murder" again  

_[II. "Excellence"]_  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs  
Huh, yeah, uh  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
Black excellence, opulence, decadence  
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present  
I dress in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris  
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs  
Do you know who I am, Clarice?  
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"  
Success never smelled so sweet  
I stink of success, the new black elite  
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast  
I repeat: my religion is the beat  
My verse is like church, my [[Jesus piece]]  
Now please, domino, domino  
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go, uh  
What's up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh  
That ain't enough, we gonna need a million more, uh  
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow  
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go, uh  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Yeah, it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go  
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P  
From parolees that hold G's, sold keys, low keys  
We like the promised land of the OG's  
In the past if you picture events like a black tie  
What's the last thing you expect to see? Black guys  
What's the life expectancy for black guys?  
The system's working effectively, that's why  
I'll be a real man, take care of your son  
Every problem you had before this day is now done  
New crib, watch a movie  
'Cause ain't nothin' on the news but the blues  
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci  
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes  
Sunday morning, praise the Lord  
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for  
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor  
Black excellence, truly yours
