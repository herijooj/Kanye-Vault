It is a weeping and a moaning and a gnashing of teeth

[Verse 1: Big Sean]  
Drop it to the floor make that ass shake  
Woah make the ground move, that’s an ass quake  
Built a house up on that ass, that’s an ass state  
Roll my weed on it, that’s an ass tray  
Say Ye, say Ye, don’t we do this err’ day-day?  
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day  
Finally got [[3. PAID|paid]], now I need shade and a vacay  
And niggas still hatin’, so much hate I need an AK  
Now we out in Paris,

Gettin’ high, Californicatin’ I give her that D,

You gon see lawyers and niggas in "Jordans"  

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]

Drinkin’ champaign on the airplane  
Spit rounds like the gun range  
Beat it up like Rampage

Grade A, A1, chain the color of Akon  
Platinum diamonds [[backpack]] around me
