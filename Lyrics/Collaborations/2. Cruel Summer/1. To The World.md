# To The World

[R. Kelly - Intro]  
Let me see you put your middle fingers up  
To the world, I made up in my mind  
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight  
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway  
Let me say it one more time  

[R. Kelly - Hook]  
Let me see you put your middle fingers up  
To the world, to the world, to the world  
To the world, to the world, to the world  
Let me see you put your middle fingers up  
Middle fingers up  

[R. Kelly - Verse 1]  
(Motherfucker) Deuces minus one  
Middle finger to the sky tonight  
The whole world is a couch  
Bitch I'm Rick James tonight (I don't give a fuck)  
Throw it up, throw it up  
Cause you can't take it with you  
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you  
To the world, to the world  
Then I'm on my Sinatra, I'm doing it my way,  
Let's take it a notch up, take it up  
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!  
To the world, I made up in my mind  
Doing things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight  
I'm doing things my way, it's my way or the highway  
Let me see you one more time  

[R. Kelly - Hook]  
Let me see you put your middle fingers up  
To the world, to the world, to the world  
To the world, to the world, to the world  
Let me see you put your middle fingers up  
Middle fingers up  

[Kanye West - Verse 2]  
Mmm ain't this some shit?  
Pulled up in the A-V-entador  
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord  
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score  
This a ghetto opera, Francis Ford Car Coppola  
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that  
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs  
Like, "These niggas tryna hold me back  
These niggas tryna hold me back", I'm just trying to protect my stacks  
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax  
[[Chicago|Chi-Town]] 'til I'm on my back, [[Chicago|Chi-Town]] 'til I'm on my back  
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axle Foley at?  
"Ease up there baby boy", Ving Rhames told Jody that  
R. Kelly and the God of rap  
Shitting on you, holy crap  

[R. Kelly - Hook]  
Let me see you put your middle fingers up  
To the world, to the world, to the world  
To the world, to the world, to the world  
Let me see you put your middle fingers up  
Middle fingers up  

[Teyana Taylor - Outro]  
I could give it all up, but it's not enough  
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger  
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the [[13. Moon|moon]]  
Here's to the mountains, yeah here's to the room  
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me  
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me
