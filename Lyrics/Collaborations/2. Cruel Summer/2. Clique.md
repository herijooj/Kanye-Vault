# Clique

What of the dollar you murdered for  
Is that the one fighting for your soul  
Or your brother’s the one that you’re running from  
But if you got money, fuck it, because I want some  

[Big Sean - Hook]  
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with my  
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique  
Ain’t nobody freshin’ than my muthafuckin’  
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique  
As I look around, they don’t [[7. DO IT|do it]] like my  
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique  
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the  
They want the, they want the  

[Big Sean - Verse 1]  
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say  
My block behind me like I’m coming out the driveway  
It’s grande, from Friday, to next Friday  
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day  
She tryna get me that poo tang  
I might let my crew bang  
My crew deeper than Wu Tang  
I’m rolling with (Huh) fuck I’m saying?  
Girl, you know my crew name  
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!  
I’m pullin’ up in that Bruce Wanye  
But I’m the fuckin’ villian, man, they kneelin when I walkin in the building  
Freaky women I be feelin’ from the bank accounts I’m fillin’  
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be  
Young player from the D that’s killin’ everything that he see  

[Big Sean - Hook]  
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with my

Translation, I’m the shit. Least that what my neck say, least that what my check say
