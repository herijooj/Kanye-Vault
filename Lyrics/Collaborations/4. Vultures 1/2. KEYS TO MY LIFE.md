# KEYS TO MY LIFE

[Intro]  
Slow down  

[Verse 1: Kanye West]  
Slow down, you on your way to an overdose  
Plus these texts gettin' way too emoji-nal  
Way too much time alone  
Told the guys that you know I'm headed home, I got a trauma bond  
Look at what I stumbled on  
Another nigga chillin' on your couch with pajamas on  
Thought I was the only one  
How dare you have a nigga in your house eatin' Papa Johns?  
Where you get that money from?  
Lookin' at how far we come, I bought your first Vacheron  
Guess we had an awesome run  
Ever since I lost my mom, you was like my foster mom  
Hold me like your only son  
Hold me like the homies in thе Chi' when they hold they guns  
Hold mе like a trophy in the sky when they know they won  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign, Ty Dolla $ign & Kanye West]  
Wasn't it always this way?  
Wasn't it always this way?  
Puttin' it all on display  
Usin' up all your sick days  
Put up with all my mistakes  
Listen to all my mixtapes  
'Posed to be always this way  
'Posed to be always this way  

[Verse 2: Kanye West]  
Couldn't it all be so simple?  
I could've used that last part for the intro  
How it sound when you got Yeezy over Timbo?  
From Uptown, but now she rockin' Yeezys over Timbos  
Like you don't see me beatin' on your window  
Like Chief Keef in the kitchen with the BDs and the endo  
But that was me when I was burnin' CDs for my friends though  
Now, I can't just take it on the chin like Jay Leno  
Now, everybody want the info  
These bitches want the pin code, these niggas swear we kinfolk  
In a Benzy with a Gen-Z gettin' gentle  
If I gotta pay for it, I'ma drive it like a rental  
You already know my M.O.​  
Is you ready for the Venmo? You already know my demo  
You already know I'm impulsive  
And another baby is my end goal  

[Outro: India Love]  
I wanna give you keys to my life, to my life, to my life, uh  
I wanna give you keys to my life, to my life, to my life, yeah (Ah-hahahaha)  
I wanna give you keys to my life, to my life, to my life, yeah
