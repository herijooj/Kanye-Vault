# KING

[Intro: Kanye West]  
After everything said, huh  
Wait, wait  
After everything said, huh  
Wait, wait  

[Chorus: Kanye West]  
"Crazy, bipolar, antisemite"  
And I'm still the king  
Still the king  
Still  
They thought headlines was my kryptonite  
Still the king  
Still the king  

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]  
This what y'all all been waitin' for, huh?  
Guess a real nigga couldn't take no more, huh  
Niggas mad 'cause they can't talk to Ye no more, huh  
It was fucks given, now it ain't no more, huh  
If you ain't mean it, what you say it for, huh?  
She just wanna fuck at the Bottega store, huh  
Way she suck me off, I should be payin' more, huh  
Addicted to my bitch 'cause she actin' like a slut  
Bring four sluts right now  
Shut the hell up 'fore you gеt exiled  
And I'm still  

[Chorus: Kanye West]  
"Crazy, bipolar, antisemitе"  
And I'm still the king  
They thought headlines was my kryptonite, bitch  
I'm still the king  
I'm still the king  

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]  
Paparazzi love me, they show up to everything  
I can pay you double, let me put you on the team  
White Castle to Italian castles, we did everything  
Sold out every stadium, bitch, we got every wing  
I don't give a— uh-uh, ooh  
Why— mmm, the king  
All that word of mouth couldn't take me out, huh-huh  
After all of that, your kids in the house goin' crazy  

[Outro: Kanye West]  
'Cause I'm still the king  
Still the king  
Still the king  
Deadlines, I gave a shit, like  
Still the king  
Still the king
