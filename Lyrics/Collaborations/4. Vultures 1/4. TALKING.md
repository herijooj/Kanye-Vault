[Part II: ONCE AGAIN]  

[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in (Ooh)  
What they held in (Held in)  
What they held in (Held in)  
What they held in (Held in)  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in (Again, once—, yeah)  
Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in  

[Verse: Ty Dolla $ign]  
How much to stop the clock from speedin'? They might try to slow down  
How much to stop my daughter from growin'? I just can't take it now  
'Cause she just doing all the shit I did when I was her age  
I don't know how I'm gonna tell her, but her dad's just afraid  
Of her choices, know that I've been through it  
I just hope I haven't been the wrong influence  
Put her on game before the world put her through it  
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh  
That's why I gotta break the curses that were sent for me  
This is hard work working, this ain't destiny  
My motivation is just lookin' at my family tree  
I'm tryna make sure I contribute for the legacy  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in (Again-again, once again)  
Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in  

[Outro: Kanye West]  
Once again, the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)  
Once again, the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)  
Once again, the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)  
Once again, the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
