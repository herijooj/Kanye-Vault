# DO IT

[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]  
Do it stay waxed?  
Do it smell fresh?  
Can I feel your juice through the latex?  
If you go 'round, do you stay wet?  
Can your homegirl watch? Can she go next?  
Need the lights on, tell her watch this  
When I make you cream, I'ma talk shit (I just wanna know)  
And you fuck back, and you got grip  
Stick your tongue out when you get your spot hit  
I just wanna know  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
All this money on the floor  
Ten racks, throw it up  
Watch how I do it, make her drop to her toes  
Bend it over, pick it up real slow  
I do it, baby, do it  
Up that work, ice like a jacuzzi  
In my bag, call me '06 Gucci  
What's happenin'? Tryna make a movie?  

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Just touched down, feelin' like Lucci  
Fuckin' on Tisha, fuckin' on Suzi  
Don't discriminate with this Uzi  
She just wanna drink, do a lil' tuci  
Beat it all day, beat it all night  
I be on gorilla, goin' Kimbo Slicе  
I be with the killers, need to pay your finеs  
Try me once, you gon' pay with your life  
All these dimes on me  
What's your set? Bitch, throw it up  
Heard you got a man, but he ain't like us  
Your bitty bands ain't doin' enough  
Know it's all on me  
This might make you fall in love  
Tellin' your friends you found the one  
And I'm like "Who?" and I'm like "What?"  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
All this money on the floor  
Ten racks, throw it up  
Watch how I do it, make her drop to her toes  
Bend it over, pick it up real slow  
I do it, baby, do it  
Up that work, ice like a jacuzzi  
In my bag, call me '06 Gucci  
What's happenin'? Tryna make a movie?  

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]  
You don't like it? That's your loss  
Your opinion don't change the show cost  
Let me know what these hoes cost  
I ain't finna pay the whole cost  
Throwin' so much money, you gon' need an audit  
God in me, so anything you want, I got it  
Southside, Do or Die, Chi-Town top five  
Four, three, two, one, who am I?  
Ye, that's Ye-Ye  
Text a ho a hunnid K, Apple payday  
If I show up where she work, I think she just might quit  
I just bought my bitch a bitch, uh  
Spendin' all this money like it's free to me  
That shit fall off trees to me  
We ain't even stress, we the new kings and sheikhs  
We done made a mess they gon' have to clean for weeks  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Kanye West]  
All this money on the floor (Yee)  
Ten racks, throw it up  
Watch how I do it, make her drop to her toes  
Bend it over, pick it up real slow  
I do it, baby, do it  
Up that work, ice like a jacuzzi  
In my bag, call me '06 Gucci  
What's happenin'? Tryna make a movie?  

[Verse 3: YG]  
Do it, do it  
She got the lil' fat, she finna lose it (She finna lose)  
Fuck her from the back, goin' stupid (Goin' stupid)  
Pullin' out the tracks, she gotta glue it (She gotta glue it)  
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, she choosy (She what?)  
Fuck her like I love her, I'm confusin' (I would)  
She don't wanna go home, she refusin'  
Hit it up the cherry bomb, that pussy poolin'  
Top boy, I ain't the lil' one  
Thugged out, bitch nigga better get a gun  
I'm him on a B, on the biggest one  
It's a opp in the party, I'm finna kill the fun  
Yeah, you tellin' all the lies  
Stay with the money, I'm with Yeezy and Dolla $ign  
That pussy wet, you would've swore I were in a water line  
The hoes love me 'cause I'm a water sign  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & YG]  
All this money on the floor (4Hunnid)  
Ten racks, throw it up  
Watch how I do it, make her drop to her toes  
Bend it over, pick it up real slow  
I do it, baby, do it  
Up that work, ice like a jacuzzi  
In my bag, call me '06 Gucci  
What's happenin'? Tryna make a movie?
