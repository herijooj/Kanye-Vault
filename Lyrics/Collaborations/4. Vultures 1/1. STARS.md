# STARS

[Intro: Dijon]  
I hope he's bright, big, and strong  
I hope he's bright, big, and strong  

[Verse 1: Kanye West]  
You already know what I'm on  
Tell 'em don't wait up for me  
Pulling up, drop top Porsche  
This that glory  
I'ma come through and just black out  
Just black out  
Keep a few Jews on the staff now  
I cash out  
We finna go where the stars at  
And beyond that  
This that rip up the contract  
Fuck all that  

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign & Dijon]  
(I hope he's bright, and big, and strong)  
I ain't gotta ask nobody  
Plug talk, plug talk, shawty  
And she wanna back it up for me  
I'ma blow your back out, shawty (Ooh)  
Got a hunnid racks in the morning  
Woo-woo-woo-woo (I hope he's bright, big, and strong)  
I ain't gotta ask nobody  
Plug talk, plug talk, shawty  
And she wanna back it up for me  
I'ma blow your back out, shawty (Ooh)  
Got a hunnid racks in the morning  
Woo-woo-woo-woo  

I hope he's bright, big, and strong, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
I hope he's bright, big, and strong, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]  
And we'll be way up in the stars
