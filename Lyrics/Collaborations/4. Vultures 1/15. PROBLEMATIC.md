# PROBLEMATIC

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
I feel like I beat a murder, murder  
Fuckin' on a bitch you never heard of, heard of  

[Verse 1: Kanye West]  
That Pope like the leader of the Vatican, he [[7. DO IT|do it]] again?  
Everything I do, they do, guess Yeezy set the trend  
And we in this bitch again, time to get rich again (Throw your motherfuckin' hands)  
They lookin' like prey, I guess that's why they prayin'  
And when you flyin' private, it can't be no delayin'  
When I speak my mind, it's gon' be some lawsuits and furniture movin'  
I gotta haul through like when you be movin'  
I gotta fly to Japan just to bе secluded  
They did no damagе, what I give 'em? No chances  
Even if they get a chance, here's panic like they know Spanish  
How I brand all of these clothes?  
How every tantrum I throw make an anthem for hoes?  
This my life, not a quote  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
I feel like I beat a murder, murder  
Fuckin' on a bitch you never heard of, heard of  

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]  
I'ma take all my baldies to Giorgio Baldis  
Throw my dick a party  
Your dress code upscale, used to shop at Aldis  
I ran up some numbers, now I got what you all need  
Give your homegirl the boric acid, save the summer  
New abs, she droppin' fast, it's time to come up  
Black out  
Passin' out and then she wakin' up gorgeous  
I'm not racist, it's a preference  
And my bitch lookin' like a reference  
Don't I make the rules like a referee?  
Come get on your knees, shawty, I got needs  
She a loud mouth  
I need to sign and seal a couple brand new deals  
Gotta get this shit off my chest, I got some shit to spill  
Passin' out NDAs, nigga, deal with it after  
I just fucked the world raw, she need a morning after  
And then the morning after  
And I quote, "It's only one G.O.A.T.," let you have your fun, though  
Run the block like Mutombo, you had it on loan  
Every day in New Jersey, on my way to New York  
I was late to every meeting, in my queen's tunnel  
But all the hoes in Hoboken know  
If I seent you outside with the open-toes  
You might get you a trip to the Poconos  
You might have to tell your man a Pinocchio  
That was a jokey-joke  
That wasn't nowhere near as funny when you brokey-broke  
Crying in high school over a high school bitch  
And she still in the dark takin' night school, bitch  
Look at how we made it like we Mike WiLL, bitch  
Wish somebody woulda warned us  
When I was fifteen, my soulmate wasn't born yet  
African [[16. KING|king]] in a different time  
We got multiple wives too, just at different times  
Picture this, if every room got a different bitch  
Do that make me a po-nigga-mist?  
Without the deals, I guarantee I'm still nigga rich  
Shit is fuckin' ridiculous
