# BACK TO ME

[Intro: Jason Mewes]  
I fell in love with you, we fell in love with you  
Guys like us just don't fall out of the fucking sky, you know?  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Let's keep zonin'  
Let's keep floatin', let's keep moanin'  
Girl, I know that it ain't over  
In the morning, you'll be runnin' back to me  
Heart was broken, I am frozen  
Now you're glowin'  
This is more than just a moment  
In the morning, you'll be runnin' back to me  

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Quavo]  
This the shit that make rap niggas mad  
Them "think they cool" niggas mad  
Bad bitches more bad  
You shouldn't have bought her more ass, shall I add?  
Tell me, where we at? (Where we at?)  
I put nerds on the map (On thе map)  
Now this Urkel in your bitch  
Did I do that?  

[Interlude: Jason Mewes]  
Beautiful, naked, big-titty womеn just don't fall out the sky, you know?  

[Verse 2: Kanye West with Jason Mewes]  
Sky, you know? Sky, you know? (Uh)  
And beautiful, big titty, butt-naked women just don't fall out the sky, you know?  
Tell me how you know  
I been searchin' high and low  
And I can tell you one thing  
Beautiful, big-titty, butt-naked women just don't fall out the sky, you know? (Uh)  
Yeezy, how you doin', huh?  
Yeezy, how you doin', huh?  
Yeezy, how you doin', huh?  
Beautiful, big titty, butt-naked women just don't fall out the sky, uh, uh  
Just don't fall out the sky, you know?  
Just don't fall out the sky, you know?  
And beautiful, big titty, butt-naked women just don't fall out the sky, you know?  
Tell me how you know  
I been searchin' high and low  
And I can tell you one thing  
Beautiful, big-titty, butt-naked women just don't fall out the sky, you know?  
Tell me how you know  
I been searchin' high and low  
And I can tell you one thing  
Beautiful, big-titty, butt-naked women just don't fall out the sky, you know?  
Just don't fall out the sky, you know?  
Sky, you know?  
They just don't fall out the sky, you know?  
They so valuable  
I been searchin' high and low  
And I can tell you one thing  
Beautiful, big-titty, butt-naked women just don't fall out the sky, you know?  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Let's keep zonin'  
Let's keep floatin', let's keep moanin'  
Girl, I know that it ain't over  
In the morning, you'll be runnin' back to me  
Heart was broken, I am frozen  
Now you're glowin'  
This is more than just a moment  
In the morning, you'll be runnin' back to me  

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs & Quavo]  
This that shit that make rap niggas mad, yeah  
Fuckin' two twins, I told her skinny was in  
So she took out all the ass, kept it natural (Yeah)  
But that thing still movin', I had to knock it down  
Yeezy, where we at? (Where we at?)  
Florence to Milan  
Just turned a bird bitch to my ex like I was Elon  
Count hundreds on the blue side, booty must've grew in size  
Seen it from the front side, damn, it must be two-sized (Yeah)  
Goddamn it, must be two sides  
Forgis on the Double R, I'm floatin' like a cruise line  
Bitches wanna fuck me, then trap me, then fuck me over  
She cryin' tears in that Maybach and not the Toyota  
Once it's over, then she dead to me, give that ho a memorial  
Suck my dick for the interview, a headitorial  
Put you on a track, have you workin' like I appointed you  
Ho, how you gon' go blockin' your blessing when I anointed you?  
Beautiful big titty, butt naked bitches, where you at? Uh  
Started off trippin', tell her, "Pay tuition", no congrats, uh  
Winin' and dinin', now to take my ratchet ho to Saks, uh  
She was too used to Hamburger Helper, chilli mac  
And that's facts, you can fact-check it  
I'm from the crack era  
Redbone bitches, they [[16. KING|king]] me like I'm a black checker  
Standin' at the plate, your ho catchin' balls like a bat catcher  
I bring my pistol when I fuck her 'cause it's all 'bout survival, ho  
I'll gut you clean, I bet you fuck with my rivals, though  
Put that on everything, a whole stack of bibles, ho  
Real niggas like me just don't fall out the sky, you know  
So keep vibin', ho  
And you know that's facts, you can fact check it  
I'm from the crack era  
Where niggas run off and work it, don't bring it back era  
Standin' at the plate, your ho catchin' balls like a back catcher  

[Outro: Jason Mewes]  
Beautiful, naked, big-titty women just don't fall out the sky, you know?
