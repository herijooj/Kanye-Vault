# CARNIVAL

[Intro: Choir & Playboi Carti]  
Go, go, go, go  
Head so good, she a honor roll  
She ride the dick like a carnival  
I done did the impossible  
Go, go, go, go  
Head so good, she a honor roll  
She ride the dick like a carnival  
I done did the impossible  
Go  
Ha, ha, ha, schyeah  

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid & Playboi Carti]  
Way too rich to drive a Rove'  
Made a milli' off the stove  
She like to put it in her nose  
Pretty bitch with white toes  
I done put on all the bros  
I done fucked her in the Rolls (Hahahaha)  
I done pulled up in the Ghost  
I done reachеd all my goals  
Yeah, yeah, pull up with Yeezy and Dolla $ign  
I'm all about business, I'm mindin' minе  
Pull up in the trenches like Columbine  
Pull up with the rocket like NumbaNine  
I don't want your hoes  
Young nigga reach all the goals  
Let her suck the dick, said she was a pro  
If she scrape her teeth, I'ma tell her to go  

[Chorus: Rich The Kid with Choir, Ty Dolla $ign & Playboi Carti]  
Go, go, go, go  
Head so good, she a honor roll  
She'll ride the dick like carnival  
I done did the impossible  
Go, go, go, go (Ha, ha)  
Head so good, she a honor roll  
She'll ride the dick like carnival  
I done did the impossible (Dolla $ign)  

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]  
She ride it like Six Flags  
We turn up to the max  
I whop her from the back  
I gave that bitch a cramp  
They love me out in France  
In the hood, I'm good, I'm stamped  
Every day, I dress all black  
For a show, nine hundred racks  
Middle East call, double that  
On my neck a bubble bath  
On my wrist, new Cadillac  
Cut her off, don't want her back  
Little bitch, I'm a superstar  
These hoes wanna fuck my car  
My dog put a nigga in park  
Gotta watch out for the narcs, ayy  

[Verse 3: Kanye West]  
This that Game of Thrones, Yeezy, not the clones  
Elon, where my rocket ship? It's time to go home  
They served us the porn since the day we was born  
Anybody pissed off, gotta make 'em drink the urine  
Now I'm Ye-Kelly, bitch, now I'm Bill Cosby, bitch  
Now, I'm Puff Daddy rich, that's Me Too me rich  
Why she say she sucked my dick? Then she say she ain't sucked my dick?  
She gon' take it up the ass like a ventriloquist  
I mean since Taylor Swift, since I had the Rollie on the wrist  
I'm the new Jesus, bitch, I turn water to Cris'  
This for what they did to Chris, they can't do shit with this  
Got my kids in a fake school, we ain't—  

[Chorus: Rich The Kid with Choir & Playboi Carti]  
Go, go, go, go  
Head so good, she a honor roll  
She'll ride the dick like carnival (Schyeah)  
I done did the impossible (Schyeah)  
Go, go, go, go  
Head so good, she a honor roll  
She'll ride the dick like carnival  
I done did the impossible  

[Verse 4: Playboi Carti]  
She ride the dick like a carnival  
Bend her over, havin' flashbacks, she gon' eat me up like a carnivore  
It's the way I pop my shit, the hoes not ready, I'm goin' barnacles  
Movin', I feel like I'm Jason, can't get arrested, I make 'em stomp, oh  
She want a private section, roll off them X's when I'm on Melrose  
She tatted my name on her titties, yeah, you can bust it, but it's a borrow  
Hol' up, sittin' back, countin' up dubs, I was raised in the borough  
She wanna taste it, checkin' the swag today, ho, come back tomorrow  
If you know what I know, hide your ho  
Just off the facts that we havin' them hunchos  
Runnin' around in the lobby, I know that they tired of me havin' like ten hoes  
She need some cresidentials just to be presidential, hol' up, hol' up  
I'm 'bout to buy her some dentures, make that ho eat me for dinner, woah, woah  
Pain all in my eyes, I can't see, uh  
I'm 'bout to jump out my body, I'm ready to leap, uh  
I'm 'bout to nut on her body and tell the ho leave, 'kay  
Fifty mil' stuffed in the bag, tell the whole gang eat, uh  
It's Ye and Barti, tell me who fuckin' with we?  
I'm hot like Tha Carter, I'm feelin' that ho in my sleep  
Dollar signs all in my dreams, I don't never see Z's, woah (Woah-woah)  
The swag cover my body like it's a disease, woah (Woah-woah)  

[Bridge: Choir]  
Woah, woah, woah  
Woah, woah, woah  

[Chorus: Choir]  
Go, go, go, go  
Head so good, she a honor roll  
She ride the dick like a carnival  
I done did the impossible  
Go, go, go, go  
Head so good, she a honor roll  
She ride the dick like a carnival  
I done did the impossible  

[Outro: Choir]  
Go, go, go, go  
Go, go, go, go  
Go, go, go, go  
Go, go, go, go
