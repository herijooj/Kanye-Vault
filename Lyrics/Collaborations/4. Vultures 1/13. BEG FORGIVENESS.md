# BEG FORGIVENESS

[Intro: Chris Brown]  
You've gone too far  
You've gone too far and you should hang your head in shame  
For these wounds, I cannot stay, you've gone too far  
You've gone too far  

[Refrain: Chris Brown]  
Wide awake and I can't hear my heartbeat  
Hope it cradles me and rocks my heart to sleep  
Protector in the light and a stranger in the dark  
You don't say anything more  
Bound by suffocating secrets I must keep  

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]  
You've gone too far  
You've gone too far and you should hang your head in shame  
For these wounds, I cannot stay, you've gone too far  
You've gone too far  

[Chorus: Chris Brown]  
Sum of all the parts that you have taken  
Are a fraction of the parts that make me whole  
For he was stronger than I was  
But it's strength you can't sustain  
Do not come to give me counsel  
You should beg forgiveness of me  

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]  
You should beg forgiveness  
You should beg forgiveness  
You should beg forgiveness  
You should beg forgiveness of me  

[Refrain: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Ty Dolla $ign]  
Wide awake and I can't hear my heartbeat  
Hope it cradles me and rocks my heart to sleep  
Protector in the light and a stranger in the dark  
He don't say anything more  
Bound by suffocating secrets I must keep  

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ty Dolla Sign]  
You've gone too far  
You've gone too far and you should hang your head in shame  
For these wounds, I cannot stay, you've gone too far  
You've gone too far  

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Ty Dolla $ign]  
Sum of all the parts that you have taken  
Are a fraction of the parts that make me whole  
For he was stronger than I was  
But it's strength you can't sustain  
Do not come to give me counsel  
You should beg forgiveness of me  

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]  
You should beg forgiveness  
You should beg forgiveness  
You should beg forgiveness  
You should beg forgiveness of me  

[Verse 1: Kanye West]  
Fuck it up one time  
I know what you want, I'm readin' the signs  
Don't let your moment pass you by  
Don't let your moment pass you by  
Had to go in my whole life  
A hundred percent covered in ice  
Put down your phone, cut off the lights, lights  
Cut off the lights, covered in ice  
And if I go tonight, know that I lived a lovely life  
Just make sure my kids are right and it is alright  
And if I go tonight, just know I lived a lovely life  
Tell my kids to live they life how they wanna live they life  

[Chorus: Choir]  
Forgiveness, beg forgiveness  
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness  
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness  
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness  
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness  
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness  
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness  
Beg forgiveness  

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Say you wanna make amends before I go  
Now you wanna put your heart on the line  
God knows the way you are  
I will wait  
I will wait, I will wait, I will wait  
I will wait  
I will wait, I will wait  
I will wait, I will wait  
I will wait, don't wait, I will wait  
I will wait  
I will wait  
I will wait  
Now you wanna be so sad  
Wanna be with me so bad after driving me so mad  
Yeah, you know, I'm still suffocating on your every lie  
Yeah, you know, I'm still wakin' up with murder on my mind  
Yeah, you know, I'm still suffocating on your every lie  
Yeah, you know, I'm still wakin' up with murder on my mind  
And you know  

[Chorus: Choir & Ty Dolla $ign]  
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness (Oh-ah-ah)  
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness (Oh-ah-ah)  
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness (Oh-ah-ah)  
Beg forgiveness (Oh-ah-ah)  
Beg forgiveness
