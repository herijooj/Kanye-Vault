[Intro: Jodeci]  
Get on up now

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
I'm just here to get paid

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]  
Come with me, I got booze and that drip misting  
Cut Wock' and the cost is fifteen  
Life flew past too fast  
Old stomach is the new ass  
He can't afford you, that's too bad  
Told her what you gon' do with a durag?  
Fuck the lame, do you write down the names?  
You was stuck, run in placе  
You ain't runnin' with the strays no more  
Roxanne, you don't havе to put on  
Yeah, I got that shit on  
Give me somethin' to spit on  
Roxanne, you don't have to race after the red light  
I got that pump, but it's off on the headlights  
Fuck the lame, do you write and your girlfriend think I'm dope?  
Really? Thanks  
Dark skin nigga only shootin' Billy Blanks  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
I'm just here to get paid  
I'm just here to get paid (Ooh, yeah)  
I'm just here to get paid (Yeah)  
I'm just here to get paid  
I'm just here to get paid (Ah-ah)  
I'm just here to get paid  
I'm just here to get paid (Yeah, yeah)  
I'm just here to get paid  

[Interlude: Marshawn Lynch]  
You know why I'm here  

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Baby, you're the hottest in the city  
You got my attention when you're with me  
All this Spanish spinning got us dizzy  
Dollars all she [[7. DO IT|do it]] for  
I throw this cash, you shake that ass  
Get that upfront, just throw it back  
It's just the job and that's a shame  
You made it plain, you keep on sayin'  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
I'm just here to get paid  
I'm just here to get paid (Ooh, yeah)  
I'm just here to get paid (Yeah)  
I'm just here to get paid  
I'm just here to get paid (Ah-ah)  
I'm just here to get paid  
I'm just here to get paid (Yeah, yeah)  
I'm just here to get paid  

[Outro: K-Ci & Kanye West]  
Everybody grab somebody  
Turn this motherfucker into a party  
Fellas, take a lady's hand  
Ladies, go and choose your man  
There's no need to be afraid  
Friday night, let's all get paid  
Friday night, let's all get paid  
Friday night, let's all get paid  
Friday night, let's all get paid  
Friday night, let's all get paid  
Friday night, let's all get paid  
Fri-Fri, let-let-let get 'ai-ai-ai-aid  
Friday night, let's all get paid  
Friday night, let's all get paid  
Friday night, let's all get paid  
Friday night, let's all get paid  
Let's all get paid  
Let's all get paid  
Let-let-let get 'ai-ai-ai-aid  
Let's all get paid (Roxanne)

Let-let-let get 'ai-ai-ai-aid  
Let's all get paid
