Smokin' on a junt with my niggas drinkin' OE  
Stop off, stop off at the liquor store, get your 'yac, then we headed for the indo  
Smokin' on a junt with my niggas drinkin' OE

I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now  
That lil' ho, she tryna fuck somethin' right now

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]  
Ooh, ooh, right now  
Shawty wanna fuck on me, I told her, "Let's go now"  
Dressed in all her fashion, she tryna show out  
Miami, Bal Harbour, before I tote, uh, ah  
I'm on the G6 brackin' shit with my pole, hah  
All-black Brabus truck, lookin' like my soul just went out  
All of my vibes is tens, gotta keep them close, they might jump out  
We might go spin and spin, just clearin' that ho before we cool out  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now  
That lil' ho, she tryna fuck somethin' right now  
I'm, I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now

[Bridge: Kanye West]  
Baby, don't keep me up, yeah, keep me up  
Don't wanna beat me up, yeah, beat me up  
Baby, don't keep me up, yeah, keep me up  
Don't wanna beat me up, yeah, beat me up  
We comin' down swervin'  
This the real, not a version  
Even Jesus ain't marry a virgin  
No weapon formed against us will win  

[Verse 2: Kanye West]  
We comin' down swervin'  
This the real, not a version  
I don't care who you fucked, you a virgin to me  
You a pervin' to me, baby perfect to me  
Hold my coat, hold my drink  
On my own, come with me  
Shawty wanna fuck on somethin'  
Fuck on me, suck on me publicly  

[Interlude: Travis Scott]  
La Flame, baby, you on fire (La Flame)  
La Flame, baby, you on fire  
La Flame, baby, you on fire (La Flame)  
La Flame, baby, you on fire (Fire)  

[Verse 3: Travis Scott & Ty Dolla $ign]  
Yeah, she feelin' herself, yeah, she feelin' on me (Yeah)  
Only sign I can give you is that one plus two is three (Oh)  
Blocked her number and that shit started with three-somethin'  
Meetin' at the threesome, we 'bout to have a mean one  
I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now (Woo)  
Brown skin, but you know I had her creamin'  
Janet Jackson by the way I had her screamin'  
She hit the group chat, say, "That nigga had me fiendin'"  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now  
That lil' ho, she tryna fuck somethin' right now  
I'm, I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now  
That lil' ho, she tryna fuck somethin' right now  

[Post-Chorus: Playboi Carti]  
Shawty wanna fuck? Woah  
I'ma let her hop on somethin'  
Shawty wanna fuck? Woah  
I'ma let her hop on somethin'  
Shawty wanna fuck? Woah  
I'ma let her hop on somethin'  
Shawty wanna fuck? Woah

[Outro: Kanye West]  
Beat me up (Oh)
