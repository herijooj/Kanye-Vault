# GOOD (DON'T DIE)

[Verse: Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign & J.Rey SOUL]  
(Ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, ooh)  
In the dark of night, these thoughts of mine keep me up all night  
Got my heart on ice, don't die, don't die  
(Ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, ooh)  
On this hopeless night, came a thousand miles to see you smile tonight  
Your smile tonight, oh  
Smile for me tonight  
(Ooh)  
Got my heart on ice, don't die, don't die  
(I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, ooh)  
Just one more time, don't die, don't die, please  
In the dark of night, thesе thoughts of mine keep me up all night  
Got my heart on icе, don't die, don't die  
(Ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, ooh)  
On this hopeless night, came a thousand miles to see you smile tonight  
Your smile tonight, oh  
Smile for me tonight  
(Ooh)  
Got my heart on ice, don't die, don't die  
(I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, ooh)  
Just one more time, don't die, don't die (Ooh), please  
(Ooh)  

[Outro: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign, J.Rey SOUL]  
Don't die, don't die (Ooh)  
Don't die, don't die (Ooh)
