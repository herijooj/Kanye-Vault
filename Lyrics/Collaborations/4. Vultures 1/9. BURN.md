# BURN

[Refrain: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Her body like the wild, wild west  
What if you don't bow down? Yeah  
Ridin' in the wind, God bless  
She's an inferno, it's a hell of a time  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign, Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign & Kanye West]  
Burnin' like a candlelight  
Your love is dangerous  
Your love is, my love is  
Our love is  
Burnin' like a candlelight (Are you not entertained?)  
Your love is dangerous  
Your love is, my love is (Are you not entertained?)  
Our love is  

[Verse: Kanye West]  
Who's not entertained by my pain?  
Who ain't cash a check off my name?  
When my campaign turned to cam-pain  
I burned eight billion to takе off my chains  
Burn, baby, burn  
Sometimes it hurts, I guess I nеver learned  
To who it may concern, the CEO of the firm  
Is now somewhere smoking sherm with Big Worm  
Man, a couple wrong turns  
Could fry you forever, it's a permanent burn  
You charging for cookie, that's bang for your buck  
If you kissin' on the mouth, you ain't charging enough  
You heard I was flyin' 'em out  
They was tryin' for clout, I was dyin' of gout  
Man, the world gone mad  
Heard R. Kelly in the next Balenciaga ad  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign, Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign & Kanye West]  
Burnin' like a candlelight (Burn)  
Your love is dangerous  
Your love is, my love is  
Our love is  
Burnin' like a candlelight  
Your love is dangerous  
Your love is, my love is  
Our love is  

[Refrain: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Her body like the wild, wild west  
What if you don't bow down? Yeah  
Ridin' in the wind, God bless  
She's an inferno, it's a hell of a time
