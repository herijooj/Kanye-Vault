Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat (Ahh, ma, what up?)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Kanye West]  
You look like a piece of hallelujah  
Wrapped up in— have mercy, Lord (Hoodrat, hoodrat)  
I know that I've got a nice whip  
But I hope that me and you could be on one accord (Hoodrat, hoodrat)  

[Verse 1: Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]  
I shot, I scored (Ahh, ma, what up?)  
I take it off the board, headboard  
Ah, boom, nigga (Nigga, ahh, ma, what up?)  
She fell in love with the sword  
I sliced, I diced, I hit it from the back  
Whore, whore (Ahh, ma, what up?)  
But I respect your feelings  
When your toes tried to touch the ceiling  
Havin' safe sex (Auntie)  
Of course, unlock the door  
Bought all the things that you could dream of  
Had I bought a Chanеl, Gucci, Pucci creamer  
But we all know thе outcome that fuck up the income  
And then some, have mercy, Lord  
And, nigga, eyes on dim sum, let the light dim some  
Catch me on your TV, heart broke GD  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Kanye West]  
You look like a piece of hallelujah  
Wrapped up in— have mercy, Lord  
I know that I've got a nice whip  
But I hope that me and you could be on one accord (Nigga)  

[Verse 2: Kanye West]  
One maker, real breath taker, real rump shaker  
Do that, whip what her mama gave her  
9-1-1, let me call my savior  
Jesus on the main line, brand new T-shirt (Ahh, ma what up?)  
Don't make me stain mine  
Drank so much, she throwin' up my gang sign  
Throwin' up my gang sign (Auntie)  
Throwin' up my gang sign (Nigga)  

[Refrain: Kanye West]  
Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat

Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat  
Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat  
Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat  
Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat (Ahh, ma, what up?)  
Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat  
Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat, hoodrat (Nigga)  

[Outro: Mike Tyson & Jason Lee]  
People are funny, they know Kanye's great too  
But the way he conducts himself, they hate to believe it  
But they can't help it, they know he's great (Right)  
Why would— Listen  
Shit Kanye say is basically affirmations what people say for success  
And it sounds insane because that's what motherfuckers do  
But he sounds insane and that's signs— sounds of a leader  
No doubt he's got some mental fuckin' issues, most leaders do  
The delusional issue, "I'm a God"
