# Tell the [[She saw the vision|Vision]] (performed by Pop Smoke)

… we made it  
… we made it  
… we made it  

… we made it (Grr, woo, bah)  
… we made it, we made it (Woo)  
… we made it (Woo)  
Thank God that I made it (Grrt, bah)  
… we made it, we made it (Woo)  
Look, mama, I made it (Grrt)  

Look, I remember the days, same 'fit for a week straight  
I used to eat fifty-cent cake, now it's Philippe's  
It's Philippe's for the steak  
Buy it, I don't care what it cost  
And I always keep a pole  
I did a hundred on a pro  
If you droppin' a woo, we come where you live  
Glock 9, infrared  
Pull up and empty the clip  
Dread had the strap all summer  
In the Floss movin' reckless  
Do not play with me, … I keep a K with me  

… we made it (Grr, woo)  
… we made it, we made it (Woo)  
… we made it (Woo)  
Thank God that I made it
