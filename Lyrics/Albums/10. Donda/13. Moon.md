# Moon (feat. Kid Cudi, Don Toliver)

I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)  
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)  
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)  
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)  
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)  
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)  

Mhm, here we go strappin', we up  
Never forget all the memories  
Sittin', I sip out my cup  
Thinkin' I should be a better me  
Truly I'm blessed from the start  
So much to say in these melodies, oh  
Stare at the sky, the moon singin' sweet  
Oh, my God, such a sweet moment  
Angels, they say I'm not ever weak, such a lonely moment  
Heaven knows I might never sleep, trouble in my soul  
Hey, I've been prayin', life can be drainin', oh  
Hey, we were late, tryna keep haulin' on  
I'm ashamed and yet, what I will see, ain't nobody knows, so I go  

How can I get through? (Don't leave so soon)  
How can I get through? (To the moon)  
How can I get through? (To the moon)  
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon (Take you to the moon)  
Don't leave so soon (Woah)  
Don't leave so soon  
How could I get through? (Yeah)  
How can I get through? (Ooh)  
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon (Ooh, take you to the moon)  
Don't leave so soon (Ooh)  
Don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)  
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)  

Yeah-yeah  
Woah-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Woah-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
