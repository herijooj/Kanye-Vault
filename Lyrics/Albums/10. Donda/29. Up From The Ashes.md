# Up From The Ashes

Up from the ashes, into the sky  
Found a Redeemer, how I survive  
Boys hug their mothers, Mary and Christ  
Your light has healed me, blessed with new life  

I could tell you, He could show you  
God in Heaven, shinin' on you  
Through your message, now I know you  
I come to you empty, free of my [[pride]]  

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)  
Praise You only, now and forever  
All the glory, it belongs to You  
By Christ's power, we're victorious  
Been set fI come to you empty, free of my pride  
We walk by faith and not by our sight  
Declaring the vict'ry, one day at a time  
God is our shepherd, light in the night  
Cure for the sick, He's eyes for the blind  

I could tell you, He can show you  
God in Heaven, shinin' on you  
Through your message, now I know You  
I come to You empty, free of my pride  

I come to You empty
