# Hurricane (feat. The Weeknd & Lil Baby)

_[The Weeknd:]_  
See this in 3D, all lights out for me  
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach  
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me  
Finally free, found the God in me  
And I want you to see, I can walk on water  
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water  
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown  
I know you won't  

_[Lil Baby:]_  
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end  
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends  
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in  
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends  
If I'ma be that same young, hungry … from West End  
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen  
Maybach interior came with sheepskin  
Still remember when I just had three bands  
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants  
Bro told me to wait to beat the game, it's only defense and  
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect  
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message  
She just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah  

_[The Weeknd:]_  
Oh-oh, I know You won't (I know You won't)  
I know You won't (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I know You won't  
I know that You look over us  
So we silently sleep  
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was out for self  
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell  
God made it rain, the devil made it hail  
[[The College Dropout|Dropped]] out of school, but I'm that one at Yale  
[[Made the best tracks and still went off the rail]]  
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town  
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in  
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit  
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick  
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids  
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'  
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement  
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it  
[[Genius]] gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk  
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?  
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much  
Fiendin' for some true love, [[ask Kim, "What do you love?"]]  
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck  
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much  
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental  
Everybody so judgemental  
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals  
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple   ^98bd12

_[The Weeknd:]_  
I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me  
No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me  
Eighty degrees, burnin' up the leaves  
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free  
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water  
Won't you shine Your light? Demons stuck on my shoulder  
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown  
I know You won't
