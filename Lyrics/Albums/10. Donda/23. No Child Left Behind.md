# No Child Left Behind (feat. Sunday Service Choir & Vory)

_[Vory:]_  
No child left behind  
No child left behind  
No child left behind  
No child left behind  
No child left behind  

Back again, I used my back against the wall  
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all  
I'll always count on God  
Back again, I used my back against the wall  
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all  
I'll always count on God  

_[Kanye West:]_  
He's done miracles on me  
He's done miracles on me  
He's done miracles on me  
He's done miracles on me  
He's done miracles on me  
He's done miracles on me
