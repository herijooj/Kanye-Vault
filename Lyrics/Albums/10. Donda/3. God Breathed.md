# God Breathed (feat. Vory)

_[Kanye West:]_  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  

_[Kanye West & Vory:]_  
I know He got His hands on this  
I know we got a chance on this  
No, I never planned on this  
I might need a band on this  
This might get banned off rip  
Gon' say somethin' for y'all quick  
Let me know something, who y'all with?  
Don't know nothing, I know this  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  

_[Vory:]_  
Oh-oh, oh-oh  
Breathed on this, breathed, breathed, oh, oh  

_[Kanye West:]_  
More than I can say for you  
Before the sons and the daughters  
Before the sun and the water  
More than I can say for you  
But the truth still for you  
Once I saw what the Lord do  
God, the Son, all the glory  
God, the Father, like Maury  
Don't care what you say, nothin' on me  
I don't care 'bout the lawyer fees  
I don't care 'bout your loyalties  
God will solve it all for me  
Trust man, he a failure  
Trust, and God'll heal ya'  
Dustin, he a Hoffman  
Don't fall what they offerin', uh  
Fall far too often, yeah, call God but don't call enough  
Fall down but don't fall in love, I know God is all in us  

I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  
I know God breathed on this  

_[Vory:]_  
Devil on my shoulders, I can't let 'em breathe  
Brush 'em off my sleeve, I'm filled with memories  
Pray they remember me, oh, oh-oh  
And I know there's an angel watchin' over me  
(All times), I inhaled and breathed  
They hearts are filled with greed  
Okay, now they want the old me  
Not too big on peoples talkin'  
Okay, now they gotta show me  
Okay, okay, Devil's talkin' to me, angel's talkin' to me  
But Angels start to tell me, "It's okay to not feel okay"  
I know that you'd be proud if you was here today  
But it's okay 'cause I'm okay  

I know God breathed on me  
I know God breathed on me  
I know God breathed on me  
I know God breathed on me
