# Jonah (feat. Lil Durk & Vory)

_[Vory:]_  
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?  
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone  
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own  
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?  
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone  
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own  

Hard to keep my focus on what matters  
Mandem hit my line like, "Some … just got hit up on your block"  
You can rest assured it's not us  
'Cause we been out the wave catchin' [[10. Waves|waves]]  
They say, "We ain't seen you on the block"  
'Cause I been out the way  
Chasin' millions in my sleep, I found the better way  
Somewhere on an island, let me kick it, this my getaway  
I pour up a drink for all my … who ain't see the day  
Tryna finish this with who I started with  
Way too many fallen soldiers, no, I can't forgot  
Hope they got headphones up in Heaven  
You can vibe out and just hear this …  
It's just certain … you can't forget  

Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?  
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone  
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own  
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?  
I hope you're here when I need the demons to be gone  
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own  

_[Lil Durk:]_  
Kanye and Jay still brothers, they both billionaires  
And we ain't see it, I lost my brother when we was millionaires  
I wasn't scared to die, but him, that was my biggest fear  
I got your son and your daughter like you still here  
Know how it feel to lose a brother, we got a bond still  
Twenty-six years, pops got out to see his son killed  
And I don't give a … if I hang with a Crip, I see blood still  
I can be the cleanest millionaire, I'm from the mud still  
Died with his chain on, I call it blood diamonds  
It's to the point I drop my own lo' so they could find us  
And it's been months and they still haven’t  
Kanye did it for the city, he co-signed

_[Kanye West:]_  
Smoke a [[opp]] pack ain't funny like that  
It get ugly like that, can't get no money like that  
Holy Father, please, let me step in  
Can't talk to buddy like that, it get bloody like that  
Whole lotta steppers and they steppin'  
And they sunny like that  
And they comin' right back  
And when you on tour, bet you check-in  
'Cause my guys back to work, it's a Monday like that  
And when you text, change the beginnin' of every word  
You will speak to me with only no cap  
Me and your big homie go back  
And homie don't rap, you don't know me like that
