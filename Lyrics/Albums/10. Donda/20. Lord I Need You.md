# Lord I Need You (feat. Sunday Service Choir)

Well, Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me  
Wrap Your arms around with Your mercy  
Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me  
I give up on doin' things my way  
And tell me everything's gonna be alright, oh  

When you said give me a ring, you really meant a ring, huh?  
Turned out to be more than just a fling, huh?  
Three hours to get back from Palm Springs, huh?  
Who you know spend an hour in Walgreens, huh?  
[[You know you'll always be my favorite prom queen]]  
Even when we in dad shoes or mom jeans  
Too many complaints made it hard for me to think  
Would you shut up? I can't hear myself drink  
We used to do the freak like seven days a week  
[[It's the best collab since Taco Bell and KFC]], uh  
Talk to me nicely, don't come at me loud  
You had a [[Benz]] at sixteen, I could barely afford a Audi  
[[How you gon' try to say sometimes it's not about me?]]  
Man, [[I don't know what I would do without me]]  
Billionaire sport, step up to the court  
They rented a room, we bought the resort  
God got me, baby, God got the children  
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'  
Time and silence a luxury  
Cussin' at your baby mama, guess that's why they call it custody  
God got us, baby, God got the children  
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'  
Time and space is a luxury  
But you came here to show that you still in love with me  
Startin' to feel like you ain't been happy for me lately, darlin'  
'Member when you used to come around and serenade me, woah  
But I guess it's gone different in a different direction lately  
Tryna do the right thing with the freedom that you gave me (Wheezy outta here)  
Your gun off safety  
Speak first, don't break me  
Harsh words, you're angry  
Lord, don't take me, oh, oh  

Well, Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me  
Wrap Your arms around with Your mercy  
Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me  
I give up on doin' things my way  
And tell me everything's gonna be alright, oh (Wheezy outta here)
