# Keep My Spirit Alive Pt. 2 (feat. KayCyy, Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine)

Ooh, ooh  
Keep my spirit alive  
Keep my spirit alive, alive  

More than enough  
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side  
The spirit won't die, die  
Oh, oh, my life, yeah  
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize  

Yo  
Flushed the work just in time and they raided, thank God (Thank God)  
Screamin' through the GT roof like ****, we done made it, thank God (Thank God)  
Hundred-round drum didn't jam when my shooter tried to spray it, thank God (Thank God)  
Couple thousand grams, got two thousand grands when we waited, thank God (Thank God)  
I was facin' fifteen and I beat it (And I beat it)  
Just spent about twenty up at Neimans (Up at Neimans)  
Did two hundred in a Demon (In a Demon, skrrt)  
I'm the illest **** and I mean it (And I mean it)  
My homie droppin' bodies for no reason (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)  
Now his kids see him on the weekends (Ah)  
Got the baking soda for the remix (Remix)  
Millionaires on, I can see it  

More than enough  
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side  
The spirit won't die, die  
Oh, oh, my life, yeah  
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize  

Yeah, don't hate me, 'cause my heart is full of love  
No weapon formed against me 'cause I'm covered in the blood  
Layin' in the hospital when I got shot, fam  
Mama prayed for me, said she left it in God's hands, yeah  
So I'ma leave it in God's hands  
Everything I'm doin' now is God's plan  
Doctor said I wouldn't walk no more, now I stand  
Then I ran, here I am, Machine  

Keep my spirit alive  
More than enough  
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side  

Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food  
Bad had tools and a bad mood  
If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body  
They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah  
Not Wakanda but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make  
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh  
Who the squad? [[Donda]]  
Who the mom? [[Donda]]  
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C  
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals  
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial  
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you  
She said "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"  
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?  
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?  
Quiet all the cordialness  
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance  
We know the Blacks, the orphans refused to be runaways  
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid  

More than enough  
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side  
The spirit won't die, die  
Oh, oh, my life, yeah  
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize
