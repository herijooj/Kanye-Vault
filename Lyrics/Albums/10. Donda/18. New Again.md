# New Again (feat. Chris Brown)

_[Kanye West:]_  
[[If I hit you with a "W-Y-D?"]]  
You better not hit me with a "H-E-Y"  
It better be like "Hiii" with a bunch of I's  
Or "Heyyy" with a bunch of Y's  
I, I lived a hundred lives, uh  
So that mean I had a hundred wives  
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time  

Never let nobody curve me that don't deserve me  
Should I really have bought the Burberry last Thursday?  
Wear a different color jersey every Thursday  
'Posed to meet in Malibu, you postin' pics in Jersey  
Is to lay me or play me a bigger flex though?  
'[[Cause you know you'd never live up to my ex though]]  
If we dive, it's the deep end, baby, let's go  
I'll be gone by the weekend, baby, XO   ^27f314

Most insane out-of-body experience  
And I repent for everything I'ma do again (I accept Him)  
And I repent for everything I'ma do again  

_[Chris Brown (Kanye West):]_  
Thank You, thank You, thank You for Your mercy, make me new  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again, make me new again  
I repent for everything that I'ma do again  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again  
(Last night don't count)  
(This morning don't count)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
If you take the ride, please don't close your eyes, uh  
In a den of thieves, every man disguise, uh  
Keep your mask on, keep it henne-tized, uh  
It's a rollercoaster, keep your hands inside, uh  
Wanna bring your pain, 'member this advice, uh  
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh  
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh  
Did it for the fame, 'member this advice, uh  
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh  
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh  
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh  
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, uh  
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh  
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, uh  
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh  

_[Sunday Service Choir:]_  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again, make me new again  
Make me new again, make me new again
