# 10. Believe What I Say

_[Lauryn Hill:]_  
Yo, yo (Check our situation)  
My men and my women  
(Yo) Yo, yo (Check our situation)  
My men and my wom…  

_[Kanye West:]_  
You need somethin' unexpected, some form of weapon  
You ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected  
Just one time for the record, just one time for the record  
Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods  

Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down  
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love  
One last sparkle to follow in my light  
One last sparkle to follow  

Man, it's too early  
What the hell you doin' wakin' me up at [[530|5:30]]?  
Why the hell are you worried?  
Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy  
I don't know want my mind alerting  
[[People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early]]  
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?  
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early  
Go on and get your best attorney  
Something's there, feel it when I heard it  
Just release the spirit, let it flow though  
How these … leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo?  
Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coco  
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats  
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo  
I ain't got my point across  
'Til we finally get across and pass the point  
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote  
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know  
I ain't never question what you was askin' for  
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for  
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more  
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off  
I be goin' through things I had to wrote  
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know  
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes  
Things I cried about, I found laughable  
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughing, no  
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know  
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no  
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know ^473acb

_[Buju Banton:]_  
Now here we are  
You know I'm not about it  
Showed you my all  
I let you into my thoughts  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down  
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love  
One last sparkle to follow in my light  
One last sparkle to follow in love  
One last sparkle to follow in my light  
One last sparkle to follow  

_[Buju Banton:]_  
Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave  
I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe  
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived  
By some dude who's more rather into greed  
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs  
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha  
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?  
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved  
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed  
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha  
I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no  
My back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down  
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love  
One last sparkle to follow in my light (Right on)  
One last sparkle to follow
