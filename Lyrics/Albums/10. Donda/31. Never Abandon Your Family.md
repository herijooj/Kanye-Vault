# Never Abandon Your Family

Two lessons that he passed along to his children  
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family  
The second was that, no matter what, you love unconditionally  
It is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is  
He vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has  

You know why my spirit's callin'  
Darkness can't take light from me  
Haven't you gone far enough?  
Sacrificed the ones you love  
Gave up on your sanity  
Like some twisted fantasy  
What would I say to everything?  
Your actions cost everything  

My, my, my family  
My family, I'm losing my family  
I'm losing my family  
Losing my family  

Cried out to you in my sleep, you thought it was a dream  
"Why won't you answer me? I'm in the room"  
"Tell mom you're sorry," she's screaming at me  
"Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?"  
"Come back tonight, daddy, please, come back tonight, daddy, please"  
"Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?"  
She don't know what this means, "How'd you become so mean?"  
I wish I never screamed, "Alcohol when you breathe"  
These things, these things, these things, these things, they sting  
"Daddy promise you'll stay, don't you love me? Love me"
