# Heaven and Hell

Children growing, women producing  
Men go work and some go stealing  
Everyone's got to make a living  

No more promos, no more photos  
No more logos, no more chokeholds  
We on Bezos, we get payrolls  
Trips to Lagos, connect like LEGOs  
Make this final, make this, my eyes closed  
Burn false idols, Jesus' disciples  
I can feel your pain now, I done bled my vein out  
New level the game now, simulation changed  
No more problems, no more argue  
No more askin', "Who really are you?"  
I know the real you, you know we feel you  
You know He hears you, you know we with you  
Straight from Beirut, [[Chicago]], Beirut  
You cray? We cray, too  
You pray? We pray, too  
Never too late for Him to save you  
This your movie 'cause no one can play you  
Devil, lay down, Devil, lay down  
This that level, make devils pray now (Heaven and Hell)  
Hold up, no peace, hold up, police  
Don't call police, just stay focused (Is on Earth)  
Pray for new life, pray for new breath  
Hey, Lord, make sure it's safe for who's left (Heaven and Hell)  
Know you can't find a place to rest  
Know the Lord my bulletproof vest (Is on Earth)  
When we survive, know that we blessed  
Save my people through the music  

Let it grrat, let it grrat, grrat  
Let it grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat  
Let it grrat, grrat, grrat  
Let it grrat, let it grrat, grrat  
Let it grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat  
Let it grrat
