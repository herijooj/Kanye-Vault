# Jail (feat. Jay-Z, Francis And The Lights)

_[Kanye West:]_  
Take what you want  
Take everything  
Take what you want  
Take what you want  

Better that I change my number so you can't explain  
Violence in the night, violence in the night  
Priors, priors, do you have any product?  
Well, that one time  
I'll be honest, I'll be honest  
We all liars  
Let it go  

I'll be honest, we all liars  
I'll be honest, we all liars  
I'm pulled over and I got priors  
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?  

Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?  
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?  
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?  
God gon' post my bail tonight  

_[Kanye West & Francis And The Lights:]_  
Don't you curse at me on text, why you try to hit the flex?  
I hold up, like, "What?"  
I scroll, I scroll up like, "Next"  
Guess who's getting 'exed?  
Like, next  
Guess who's getting 'exed?  
You made a choice that's your bad, single life ain't so bad  
But we ain't finna go there  
Something's off, I'll tell you why  
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?  
What a grand plan to sell you out  
I could scream and shout, let it out  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I'll be honest, we all liars  
I'll be honest, we all liars  
I'm pulled over and I got priors  
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?  

Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?  
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?  
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?  
God gon' post my bail tonight  

_[Jay-Z:]_  
God in my cell, that's my celly  
Made in the image of God, that's a selfie  
Pray five times a day, so many felonies  
Who gon' post my bail? Lord, help me  
Hol' up, [[Donda]], I'm with your baby when I touch back road  
Told him, "Stop all of that red cap, we goin' home"  
Not me with all of these sins, castin' stones  
This might be the return of [[Watch The Trone|The Throne]] (Throne)  
Hova and [[Yeezus]], like Moses and Jesus  
You are not in control of my thesis  
You already know what I think 'bout think pieces  
Before you ask, he already told you who he think he is  
Don't try to jail my thoughts and think pre-cents  
I can't be controlled with programs and presets  
Reset  
On my cell, in my cell tonight  
Don't have to see you to touch you  
This is what braille look like, it's [[1. On Sight|on sight]]  
If they take me to jail, call my girl, tell her send my mail  
We know what Hell look like  
Still, it's a [[10. Hell of a Life|hell of a life]], [[2. Yikes|yikes]]

_[Kanye West:]_  
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?  
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?  
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?  
God gon' post my bail tonight
