Everything we did for the crib  

Everything we did, how we live (What?)  
All this smoke got a scent  
All that smoke heaven sent (Scent)  
Everything I spoke, what I meant (Ah)  
Never disguise my intent, lines outside the event  
Brought my life out the trench  
God, thank God, look what He did, did, did, did, did, did  
We off the grid, grid, grid, grid, grid (Ayy)

Uh, them off the grid, I'm on a [CENSORED] diet (What?)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
We off the grid, grid, grid, grid

Flexin' with the business trip  
Going cray, take some G6  
Lit, lit, '76  
He spit this  
We off the grid, grid, grid  

_[Fivio Foreign:]_  
Yeah, look, when I was in jail, I was lowkey (Uh)  
Shout out to supporters that wrote me  
Eat food, work out and then go sleep  
You know I'm prayin', he carryin' both feet (Yeah)  
[CENSORED] know we got God with us (God with us)  
You look at me and see a God figure (Uh)  
And when I start vibin', I know that He with me  
And I'ma always catch a hard shiver (Uh)  
I know it's demons in that dark liquor (Uh)  
We buy a bottle and squash with ya (Uh)  
Everybody turn into a harsh [CENSORED]  
But my pockets bigger and my heart richer (Uh)  
My mind smarter, my [[Grind|grind]] harder (Skrr)  
And my car quicker (Skrrt)  
I met her in church, she pray for me  
She my God-sister (She my God-sister, yeah)  
I'm only trustin' the people I keep close  
[CENSORED] sellin' they soul for a repost  
Remember when I was broke, wearin' cheap coats  
Now it's diamonds and houses and C notes (Uh)  
[CENSORED], I'm feelin' marvelous (I'm feelin' marvelous)  
Who let the monster loose? (Who let the monster loose? Huh)  
They call me a product of my environment (Uh)  
I tell them, "Nah, I'm what God produced" (Baow)  
Defense good, and them guards can shoot (Baow)  
I put 'em on you, it get hard to move  
Tattoo in my face is the mark of truth  
Gotta watch what you say when they market you (Huh)  
I already predicted this (I already predicted this, huh)  
Y'all only witnessed it (Y'all only witnessed it)  
Look, got a couple old friends that I'm not really clickin' with  
I know they pray that we settle our differences  
I pray that they lower all my [CENSORED] sentences  
I got some demons I'm not even dealin' with  
They in they feelings, I'm not really feelin' it  
And I know some members that gave back they membership  
[CENSORED], you switched up, huh, like how you not feelin' me?  
Look, I act like I care, but I don't really care  
Now I live in a new buildin' with amenities  
I got a new ceilin' with a chimney

I don't get too friendly with the enemy  
You gotta move different when you in the industry, woo, yeah  
You gotta move different when you in the industry, huh  
You gotta move different when you in the, look  
God blessed me with amazing grace (Uh)  
She fell in love with my day to day (Uh)  
I just want my problems to fade away (Uh)  
Man, I'm tired of [CENSORED], I need Gatorade  
Boy, I got on my feet and I made a name  
And I made it a necklace, huh  
When you from the bottom and you workin' hard  
Just to get to the top, then they gotta respect it  
If you got a voice, then you gotta project it  
If you got a wrong, then you gotta correct it  
If you got a name, then you gotta protect it  
If you give me shock, then you gotta electric (Woo)  
Tryna live a new life, so I got a new plan that I gotta finesse with (Look, yeah)  
'Cause they want me to lose, they ain't part of the Woos  
I been tryin' so hard not to move reckless  

_[Kanye West:]_  
We off the grid, grid, grid  
This for my kid, kid, kid  
Everything we did for the crib did here  
Flexin’ with the business trip  
Going cray, take some G6 (Ah)  
Lit, lit, '76  
He split lids, then ask for shade, tsk-tsk-tsk  
Take this trip, trip, trip, this, this  
This, this, this, this  
You all still lit, lit, lit  
I'm off the grid, grid, grid, grid  
Off the grid, grid, grid, grid  

First, it go viral, then they get digital  
Then they get critical, no, I'm not doin' no interview  
Mask on my face, you can't see what I'm finna do  
Had to move away from people that's miserable  
Don't wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you  
Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you  
Don't get me mad 'cause I don't wanna injure you  
She put my paintings inside of her living room  
Look at the problems and issues I'm livin' through  
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle  
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general  
Drop me the lo' and then that's where I send it to  
I was forgettin' you, now I remember, now I remember  
Did what I want and I say what I want  
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?  
I got this God power, that's my leverages  
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages  
I gotta help myself out of selfishness  
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges  
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with  
I gotta tell 'em "sorry," they too delicate  
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is  
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it  
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy  
[[I talk to God every day, that's my bestie]]  
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi  
And this money could never neglect me  
I pray that my family, they never resent me  
And she fell in love with me soon she met me  
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy  
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty  
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me  
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me  
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me  
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me  
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see  
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me  
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me  
Nah, I get 'em fast, see  
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me  
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me   ^1e2f95

We off the grid, grid, grid  
This for my kid, kid, kid  
For when my kid, kid, kids have kids  
Everything we did for the crib  

Pray for what folks and them did  
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give  
May God forbid-bid-bid  
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids  
Took off His list, list, list  
Look what they did, did, did  
Pray for the crib, crib, crib  
Some say A-A-Adam could never be bla-a-ack  
'[[Cause a black man'll never share his rib]], rib, rib, rib, rib, rib ^92cf9f
