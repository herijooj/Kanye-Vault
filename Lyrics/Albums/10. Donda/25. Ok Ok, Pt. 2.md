_[Kanye West (Fivio Foreign):]_  
Okay, now they got me wanna rap again  
Healed up wound and then you stab me in my back again (Uh)  
You the type to play the joke and try to hide your hand (Uh)  
Not the type to come around and try to play your friend  
You the type to cut the grass and snake your bestest man  
I'm the type to close the deal and cut my … in  
See me in person, I look like a ghost (Grrr)  
See me in person, I look like a ghost (Baow)  
You wanna come in and play with the G.O.A.T. (Baow)  
You wanna come in and play with the G.O.A.T. (God body)  
All you rap … sound like me, can't tell who is who  
You got no real identity, can't tell you from you  
Price went up (Yeah), angel investor (Yeah)  
Price went up (Uh), angel investor  

_[Kanye West (Shenseea):]_  
Okay, okay, I'm not okay (Not okay)  
Think you're good, it's not okay (No, they all away)  
Okay, okay, not okay (I'm not okay)  
Think you're good, get out the way

_[Shenseea:]_  
Nuh trust any and any man (Any man)  
Pree dem man, mi play along (Play along)  
Watch how dem ah sing mi song  
Suddenly dem tun ah fan  
Aim with precision  
Fi number one position  
Write the plan, right my wrong  
And look, now I'm the boss in charge  
Used to talk down 'pon me, now me on top  
Left mi inna struggle suh nuh badda come back  
Tek mi fi granted, tek mi fi soft  
And if yuh play hard  
If yuh let me down, mi nah have nuh food fi give yuh, right? Yuh know mi lock di shop down  
Mi did like when you show luv to mi face, then chat behind mi back  
Nuh trust people, cyaan trust people  
From dem eat the fruit, mankind tun evil

Mi nuh cyar how much memories we have in the past  
Yuh bruk up wid yuh ex, still in love, suh yuh single  
Mi bruk up wid mi ex, him dead to me, I'm a widow  
Get cut off, you will get cut off  
Mi nuh cyar how much memories we have in the past (Hmm)  
Bruk up wid yuh ex, still in love, suh yuh single  
Mi bruk up wid mi ex, him dead to me, I'm a widow, uh  

_[Rooga:]_  
Yeah, it's been plenty times you closed the door on me  
That … really show me how much you say you a bro to me  
Showed you love and you constantly cold-shouldered me  
But ain't no goin' back to fixin' up, that's the older me, yeah  
I'm done with all the fake … I had enough of that, yeah  
I done had too many … stab me in the back (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
They say they with you, but they really puttin' on an act  
That's when … hit the fan and all of a sudden, all the facts show  
You gotta chin up and show a … tough love  
Let 'em go without you just to show 'em what it was  
We was so close, you would've thought we was blood  
We got the same pain, we come from the mud  
I swear this … make me wanna put my all in it, yeah  
You can hear the pain 'cause I put my heart in it, yeah  
Most of these … ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no  
Most of these … ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no  

_[Kanye West (Rooga):]_  
But it's okay, we gon' be okay  
Only show up when we cut the cake (Oh, yeah)  
Showin' love, but we okay (We okay)  
Find God 'fore it's too late
