# [[Donda]] (Interlude) (feat. Stalone & The World [[4. Famous|Famous]] Tony Williams)

Forever, yeah  
Can you hear me? Yeah  
Forever, yeah  
Forever, forever, no  
Oh yeah, glory, glory, glory  
Glory, glory, glory, glory  

It feels good to be home  
And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support  
For your support of me for so many years  
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do  
What do you want me to talk about?  
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous  
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to  
And you know, I am my son's mother  
The man I describe in the introduction as being so decidedly different  
My son (When you're runnin' outta time and you're not outta time)  
And what made the project extra special to me is  
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me  
But what he has meant to a [[This generation's closest thing to Einstein|generation]] (Change the time)  
As one writer said, we came from somewhere  
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers  
But from a long line of generations who came before us  

It's the kingdom (It's the kingdom)  
And the [[3. Power|power]] (And the [[3. Power|power]])  
And [[11. The Glory|the glory]] (And [[11. The Glory|the glory]])  
Forever (Forever)  
It's the kingdom (It's the kingdom)  
And the [[3. Power|power]] (And the [[3. Power|power]])  
And [[11. The Glory|the glory]] (And [[11. The Glory|the glory]])  
Forever (Forever)  

Forever, yeah  
Forever, yeah  
Forever, forever, no  
Oh yeah, glory, glory, glory  
What did I teach him? (Glory)
