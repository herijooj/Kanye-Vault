# Ghost Town (feat. 070 Shake, PARTYNEXTDOOR)

_[Shirley Ann Lee:]_  
Some day, some day  
Some day I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown  

_[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]_  
Some day, some day, some day  
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday  
Hold up, hold up  
Some day, some days, I remembered this on a Sunday  
Back way, yeah, way, way, burning, mhm-mhm  
Uh, some days, not gonna please everybody  
Some days I wanna hit the red dot on everybody  
Some days, oh (Heatstroke)  
Now that I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana  
Now that I'm livin' high, I do what I wanna, oh, yeah  

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
I've been tryin' to make you love me  
But everything I try just takes you further from me  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Some day we gon' set it off  
Some day we gon' get this off  
Baby, don't you bet it all  
On a pack of Fentanyl  
You might think they wrote you off  
They gon' have to rope me off  
Someday the drama'll be gone  
And they'll play this song on and on  
Sometimes [[I take all the shine]]  
Talk like I drank all the wine  
Years ahead but way behind  
I'm on one, two, three, four, five  
No half-truths, just naked minds  
[[Caught between space and time]]  
This not what we had in mind  
But maybe some day  

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
I've been tryin' to make you love me  
But everything I try just takes you further from me  

_[070 Shake:]_  
Whoa, once again I am a child  
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah  
Of everything that I know, yeah  
[[And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free]]  
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah  
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah  
[[And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free]]  
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah  
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah  
[[And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free]]  
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah  
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah  
[[And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free]]  
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah  
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah  
[[And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free]]
