# No Mistakes (feat. Kid Cudi, Charlie Wilson)

_[Slick Rick:]_  
Believe it or not  
Believe it or not  

_[Charlie Wilson and Kid Cudi:]_  
Make no mistake, girl, still love you  
Make no mistake, girl, still love you  
Make no mistake, girl, still love you  
Make no mistake, girl, still love you  

_[Kanye West and Slick Rick:]_  
Take the top off, let the sun come in (The lord still shines on you)  
Whoa, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (Again)  
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard  
I had [[debt]] on my books, it's been a shaky-ass year  
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see  
[[I don't take advice from people less successful than me]]  
Hah? Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off  
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off  
Had to tell the dogs, "Turn the snubs off!"  
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost  
(Believe it or not) [[These two wrongs'll right you]]  
(Believe it or not) I was too grown in high school  
(Believe it or not) The true soul of Ice Cube  
Too close to snipe you, truth told, I like you  
Too bold to type you, too rich to fight you  
Calm down, you light skin!  

_[Charlie Wilson and Kid Cudi (Slick Rick):]_  
Make no mistake, girl, still love you (Make no)  
Make no mistake, girl, still love you (No way)  
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)  
Make no mistake, girl, still love you  
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)  
Make no mistake, girl, still love you  
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)  
Make no mistake, girl, still love you (No way)  
Make no mistake, girl, still love you
