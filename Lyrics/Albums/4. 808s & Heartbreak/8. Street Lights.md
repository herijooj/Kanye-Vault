# Street Lights

Let me know  
Do I still got time to grow?  
Things ain't always set in stone  
That be known let me know  
Let me  

Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be  
Just like moments, passing, in front of me  
So I hopped in the cab and I [[3. PAID|paid]] my fare  
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there  
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be  
Just like moments, passing, in front of me  
So I hopped in the cab and I [[3. PAID|paid]] my fare  
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there  

In the streets  
In the streets  
I'm just not there in the streets  
I'm just not there  
Life's just not fair
