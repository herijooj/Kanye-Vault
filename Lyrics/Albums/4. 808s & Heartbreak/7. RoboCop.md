# RoboCop

'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen  
Straight up out a movie scene  
Who knew she was a drama queen  
That'd turn my life to Stephen King's?  
Up late night like she on patrol  
Checking everything like I'm on parole  
I told her there's some things she don't need to know  
She never let it go, oh  

OK, OK, OK, OK  
You will never stop it now  
You never stop it now  
OK, OK, OK  
You will never stop it now  
You need to drop it now  
Drop it, drop it  

'Cause I don't want no RoboCop  
You moving like a RoboCop  
When did you become a RoboCop?  
Now I don't need no RoboCop  

Just looking at your history  
You're like the girl from Misery  
She said she ain't take it to this degree  
Well let's agree to disagree  
[[Shorty]] kind of crazy but it turn me on  
Keep it up enough to keep it going on  
[[I did some things but that's the old me|I told her there's some things she don't need to know]]  
She never let it go, oh  

OK, OK, OK, OK  
You will never stop it now  
You never stop it now  
OK, OK, OK  
You will never stop it now  
You need to drop it now  
Drop it, drop it  

'Cause I don't want no RoboCop  
You moving like a RoboCop  
When did you become a RoboCop?  
Somebody please make her stop  

Stop, drop, roll, pop  
Bitch, I'm cold  
I ain't used to being told, "Stop"  
So I could never be your robot  
Fast or slow, you can stay or can go  
Now, now that you know  
Now, now that you know  
Yeah I had her before but that happened before  
You get mad when you know so just don't ask me no more  
OK, OK, OK, uh, uh  
It ain't OK, OK, OK, uh  

You spoiled little LA girl  
You're just an LA girl  
You spoiled little LA girl  
You're just an LA girl  
You spoiled little LA girl  
You're just an LA girl (You need to stop it now)  
You spoiled little LA girl  
You're just an LA girl (You need to stop it now)  
Oh you're kidding me  
You must be joking  
Or you are smoking  
Oh oh you're kidding me  
Oh you're kidding me  
Ha-ha, that was a good one  
Your first good one in a while  
Your first good one in a while  
You need to stop it now  
You need to stop it now  
Oh you need to stop it now
