# Paranoid (feat. Mr Hudson)

_[Kanye West:]_  
She really thought that? (Yeah)  
Yeah, she's so paranoid (Yeah, that's good, paranoid)  
Girls gonna love this song, a-ha-ha  
Why are you so paranoid? (A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)  
Don't be so paranoid, don't be so  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Baby, don't worry 'bout it  
Hey there, don't even think about it  
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things  
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things  
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things  
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Tell me right now  
You really wanna spend your whole life alone?  
A little time out might do you good  
Might do us good 'fore we be done for good  
'Cause I could make it good, I could make it hood  
I could make you come, I could make you go  
I could make you high, I can make you fly  
Make you [[3. Touch The Sky|touch the sky]], hey, maybe so  
All of the time  
You be up in mine checkin' through my cell phone, baby, no  
You wanna kill the vibe on another night  
Here's another fight, oh, here we go (Oh, here we go)  

_[Kanye West, Mr. Hudson and Kid Cudi:]_  
Baby, don't worry about it  
Lady, we'll go out to the floor  
Anyway, they don't know you (They don't know) like I do  
They'll never know you (Never know)  
Anyway, they don't know you (Never know) like I do  
They'll never know you  

_[Kanye West:]_  
All of the time  
You wanna complain about the nights alone  
So now you're here with me, show some gratitude  
Leave the attitude way back at home  
Yeah, you see 'em look  
Baby, let 'em look, give ya cold looks 'cause we look cold  
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth  
Don't worry about what we can't control  
All the talk in the world lost in the world  
'Til you finally let that thing go  
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel  
But sorry, we're closed  

_[Kanye West, Mr. Hudson and Kid Cudi:]_  
Baby, don't worry about it  
Baby, we'll go out to the floor  
Anyway (Hey) they don't know you (To the floor) like I do (Hey)  
They'll never know you (Never know)  
Anyway, they don't know you (They don't know) like I do  
They'll never know you  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Baby, don't worry about it  
Lady, don't even think about it  
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things  
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things  
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things  
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things  

_[Mr. Hudson and Kid Cudi:]_  
Anyway, they don't know you like I do  
They'll never know you  
Anyway, they don't know you like I do  
They'll never know you  
Anyway, they don't know you like I do  
They'll never know you  
Anyway, they don't know you like I do  
They'll never know you
