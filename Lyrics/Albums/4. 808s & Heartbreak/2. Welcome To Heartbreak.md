# Welcome To Heartbreak (feat. Kid Cudi)

_[Kanye West:]_  
My friend showed me pictures of his kids  
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs  
He said his daughter got a brand new report card, card  
And all I got was a brand new sports car, oh  

_[Kid Cudi and Kanye West:]_  
And my head keeps spinning  
Can't stop having these [[She saw the vision|vision]]
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
And my head keeps spinning  
I can't stop having these visions  
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed  
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first class  
Chased the [[5. Good Life|good life]] my whole life long  
Look back on my life and my life gone  
Where did I go wrong?  

_[Kid Cudi and Kanye West:]_  
And my head keeps spinning  
Can't stop having these visions  
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
And my head keeps spinning  
I can't stop having these visions  
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I've seen it, I've seen it before  
I've seen it, I've seen it before  
I've seen it, I've seen it before  
I've seen it, I've seen it before  

_[Kanye West:]_  
My god-sister getting married by the lake  
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take  
Bad enough that I [[honored by my lateness|showed up late]]  
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake  
Welcome to heartbreak  

_[Kid Cudi and Kanye West:]_  
And my head keeps spinning  
Can't stop having these visions  
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
And my head keeps spinning  
I can't stop having these visions  
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Ooh-hoo  
Ooh-hoo  
Ooh-hoo  
And I, and I can't stop  
No, no, I can't stop  
No, no, no, no, I can't stop  
No, no, no, no, I can't stop  
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop  
No, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no  
No, no, I can't stop  
No, can't stop having these visions  
I gotta get with it  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
Hoo-hoo, ho-ho-hoo  
Ooh-hoo
