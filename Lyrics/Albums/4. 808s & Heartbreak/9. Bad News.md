# Bad News

Didn't you know, I was waiting on you  
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true  
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you  
My face turned to stone when I heard the news  
When you decide to break the rules  

'Cause I just heard some real bad news  

People'll talk like it's old news  
I played it off and act like I already knew  
Let me ask you how long have you known dude  
You played it off and act like he's brand new  
When you decide, to break the rules  

'Cause I just heard some real bad news  
Real bad news  
Real bad news  
Real bad news  

Oh, you just gon' keep another no you won't  
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew  
Oh, you just gon' keep another love for you  
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew  
While I'm waiting on a dream that'll never come true  
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew  
My face turned to stone when I heard the news  

What's on the news?
