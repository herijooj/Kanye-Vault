# You'll Never Find Nobody Better Than Me

Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold  
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up  
'Cause I already know how this thing go  
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me  
They say that they don't see what you see in me  
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
