# 1. Say You Will

Why would she make calls out the blue?  
Now I'm awake, sleep (less in June) or (missing you)  

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will, unless you will  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will  

Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room  
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon  

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will, you do  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will  

When I grab your neck, I touch your soul  
Take off your cool then lose control  

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will, you will, you will  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will  

I wish this song would really come true  
[[I admit I still fantasize about you]], about you   ^75b8d6

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will, you will, you will  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will
