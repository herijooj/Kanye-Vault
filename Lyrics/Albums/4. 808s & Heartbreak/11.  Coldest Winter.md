# Coldest Winter

On lonely nights, I start to [[19. Fade|fade]]  
On lonely nights, I start to [[19. Fade|fade]]  
Her love's a thousand miles away  
Her love's a thousand miles away  

Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?  
Memories made in the coldest winter  

It's 4 A.M. and I can't sleep  
It's 4 A.M. and I can't sleep  
Her love is all that I can see  
Her love is all that I can see  

Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?  
Memories made in the coldest winter, winter, winter  
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?  
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?  
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?  

If spring can take the snow away  
If spring can take the snow away  
Can it melt away all our mistakes  
Can it melt away all our mistakes  

Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend, I won't ever love again  
Never again
