# Amazing (feat. Young Jeezy)

_[Kanye West:]_  
It's amazing, I'm the reason  
Everybody fired up this evening  
I'm exhausted, barely breathing  
Holding on to what I believe in  

_[Kanye West:]_  
No matter what, you'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I'm a [[6. Monster|monster]], I'm a killer  
I know I'm wrong, yeah  
[[I'm a problem]]  
That'll never ever be solved   ^6463d6

_[Kanye West:]_  
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I'm a [[6. Monster|monster]], I'm a maven  
I know this world is changing  
Never gave in, never gave up  
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of  

_[Kanye West:]_  
No matter what, you'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  

_[Young Jeezy:]_  
I'm amazing (Amazing) yeah I'm all that (All that)  
If I ain't on my [[Grind]], then what you call that? (What you call that?)  
Victorious, yeah we warriors  
We make history, strive off victory (Yeah)  
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium  
Die high blood pressure, either let the Feds catch ya (Yeah)  
I'm amazing, born on a full [[13. Moon|moon]]  
I was bred to get it in, no spoon  
That's why I'm so goon, summertime, no June  
Big family, small house, no room  
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard?  
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"  

_[Kanye West:]_  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing  
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
