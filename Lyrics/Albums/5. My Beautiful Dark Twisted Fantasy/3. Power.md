# Power (feat. Dwele)

_[Kanye West:]_  
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it  
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it  
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it  
[[I guess every superhero need his theme music]] ^72954e

_[Kanye West:]_  
No one man should have all that power  
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours  
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power  
(21st-century schizoid man)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open  
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling  
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling  
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands  
[[4. All Falls Down#^b130ba|In this white man world, we the ones chosen]] ^5fa4ff

So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning  
Huh? I'll see you in the morning  
This is way too much, I need a moment  

_[Kanye West:]_  
No one man should have all that power  
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours  
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power  
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours  
And they say, and they say  
And they say, and they say  
And they say, and they say

_[Kanye West:]_  
Fuck [[SNL]] and the whole cast  
[[Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass]]  
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole  
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes  
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon  
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in  
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic  
[[He knows he's so fuckin' gifted]]  
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts  
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault  
[[My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty]]  
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts  
Reality is catching up with me  
Taking my inner child, [[5. All Of The Lights|I'm fighting for custody]]  
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me  
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece ^f6723e

_[Kanye West:]_  
Thinking no one man should have all that power  
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours  
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder  
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours  
And they say, and they say  
And they say, and they say  
And they say, and they say  
(21st-century schizoid man)  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Colin Powells, Austin Powers  
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation  
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation  
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation  
At the end of the day, goddamned, I'm killing this shit  
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit  
[[I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick]]  
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?  
[[How Ye doing? I'm survivin']]  
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'  
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?  
I got the power make your life so excitin' ^5704c6

_[Kanye West and Dwele:]_  
Now this will be a beautiful death  
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go  
I'm letting everything go  
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death  
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go  
I'm letting everything go  
Now this will be a beautiful death  
Jumping out the window, letting everything go  
Letting everything go  
[[You got the power to let power go?]]
