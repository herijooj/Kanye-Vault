# Gorgeous (feat. Kid Cudi & Raekwon)

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
[[3. Stronger|Ain't no question if I want it, I need it]]

I can feel it slowly drifting away from me  
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying  
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down  
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it  
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me  
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus  
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Penitentiary chances, the [[8. Devil in a New Dress|devil dances]]

And eventually answers to the call of autumn  
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'  
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin  
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums  
Based off the way we was branded  
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon  
And at the airport, they check all through my bag  
And tell me that it's random  
But we stay winning  
This week has been a bad massage, [[I need a happy ending  And a new beginning|I need a happy ending]]

And a new beginning and a new fitted  
And some job opportunities that's lucrative  
This the real world, homie, [[Graduation|school finished]]

They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it  
[[I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS]]  
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it? ^247bb3

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it  
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me  
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying  
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?  
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing  
But this is more than just my road to redemption  
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention  
As long as I'm in [[Pink Polo|Polo]] smiling, they think they got me  
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me  
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me  
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet  
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus  
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics  
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish  
Choke a South Park writer with a fish-stick  
I insisted to get up off of this dick  
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it  
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted  
[[If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it]] ^acd932

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it  
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me  
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying  
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I need more drinks and less lights  
And that American Apparel girl in just tights  
She told the director she tryna get in a school  
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"  
It's been a while since I watched the tube  
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news  
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today  
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday  
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?  
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach  
My guy said I need a different approach  
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke  
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes  
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O  
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it  
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit  
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes  
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it  
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?  
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic  
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all  
I don't really give a fuck about it at all  
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me  
Forgot about two things, my Black balls ^b988ce

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it  
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me  
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying  
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down  

_[Raekwon:]_  
Ayy, yo  
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid  
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes  
Counting up, smoking, one cuff  
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it  
Steam about a hundred and one Ls  
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson  
Nigga hat game was special  
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals  
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head  
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead  
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk  
The black Dutch, back of the old shed  
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in  
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep [[Grind|grinding]]  
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan  
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye  

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it  
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me  
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus  
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
