# I Guess Every Superhero Need His Theme Music

I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it  
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it  
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it

# For My Theme Song

[[2. Black Skinhead#^41577c|For my theme song, my leather black jeans on]]  
My by any means on, pardon I'm getting my scream on
