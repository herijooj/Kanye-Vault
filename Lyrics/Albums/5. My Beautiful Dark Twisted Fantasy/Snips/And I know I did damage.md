# And I Know I Did Damage

Never was much of a romantic  
I could never take the intimacy  
[[9. Runaway#^37ed65|And I know I did damage]]  
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me  
I guess you knew of that advantage  
'Cause you could [[11. Blame Game|blame me]] for everything  
And I don't know how I'ma manage  
If one day, you just up and leave
