# You Should Be Grateful a Nigga Like Me Ever Noticed You

> [!quote] You Should Be Grateful a Nigga Like Me Ever Noticed You
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you  
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you  
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?  
[[11. Blame Game#^d19ee6|You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you]]  
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you  
1 A.M. and can't nobody get a hold of you  
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
