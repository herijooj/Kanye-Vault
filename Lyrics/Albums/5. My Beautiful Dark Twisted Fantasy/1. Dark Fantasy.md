# Dark Fantasy

_[Nicki Minaj:]_  
You might think you've peeped the scene  
You haven't, the real one's far too mean  
The watered-down one, the one you know  
Was made up centuries ago  
They made it sound all wack and corny  
Yes, it's awful blasted boring  
Twisted fictions, sick [[11. Addiction|addiction]]  
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen  

_[Justin Vernon and Teyana Taylor:]_  
[[3. Touch The Sky|Can we get much higher]]? (So high)  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)  
Can we get much higher? (So high)  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? (So high)  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)  
Can we get much higher? (So high)  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I fantasized 'bout this back in [[Chicago]]  
Mercy, mercy me, that Murci√©lago  
That's me the first year that I blow  
How you say broke in Spanish? Mi no hablo  
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo  
Me found bravery in my bravado  
DJs need to listen to the models  
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?  
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)  
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?  
I'm just a [[Chicago|Chi-Town]] nigga with a Nas flow  
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo  
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow  

_[Justin Vernon and Teyana Taylor:]_  
Can we get much higher?  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion  
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis  
Beyond the truest  
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?  
And refresh the page and restart the memory?  
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?  
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy  
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me  
The plan was to drink until the pain over  
[[But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?]]  
Fresh air, rollin' down the window  
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low  
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh  
Don't make me pull the toys  
And fire up the engines, huh  
And then they make noise ^f3972d

_[Justin Vernon and Teyana Taylor:]_  
Can we get much higher? (So high)  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh  

_[Justin Vernon and Kanye West:]_  
At the mall, there was a seance  
Just kids, no parents  
Then the sky filled with herons  
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron  
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us  
And the fires did declare us  
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress  
And woke up back in Paris  

_[Justin Vernon and Teyana Taylor:]_  
Can we get much higher? (So high)  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh  

_[Justin Vernon and Teyana Taylor:]_  
Can we get much higher? (So high)  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)  
Can we get much higher? (So high)  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? (So high)  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)  
Can we get much higher? (So high)  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
