Turn up the lights in here, baby  
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this  
Turn up the lights in here, baby  
You know what I need, want you to see everything  
Want you to see all of the lights  

_[Elly Jackson and Rihanna:]_  
Fast cars, shooting stars  
All of the lights, all of the lights  
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are (All of the lights)  
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life  
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Somethin' wrong, I hold my head  
MJ gone, our nigga dead  
I slapped my girl, she called the feds  
I did that time and spent that bread  
I'm heading home, I'm almost there  
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs  
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me  
I had to take him to that ghetto university  

_[Kanye West:]_  
(All of the lights), lights  
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights  
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)  
Fast life, drug life, thug life  
Rock life every night (All of the lights)  

_[Rihanna:]_  
Turn up the lights in here, baby  
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this  
Turn up the lights in here, baby  
You know what I need, want you to see everything  
Want you to see all of the lights  

_[Kanye West:]_  
[[Restraining order, can't see my daughter]]  
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order  
Public visitation, we met at Borders  
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive  
I made mistakes, I bumped my head  
Them courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread  
She need her daddy, baby, please  
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university   ^77902f
