# Blame Game (feat. John Legend)

_[Kanye West:]_  
Whose fault?  

_[John Legend:]_  
Let's play the blame game, I love you more  
Let's play the blame game for sure  
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more  
Let's call out names, names for sure  

_[John Legend:]_  
I'll call you bitch for short  
As a last resort and my first resort  
You call me motherfucker for long  
[[At the end of it, you know we both were wrong]] ^a23bd6

_[John Legend:]_  
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more  
Let's play the blame game for sure  
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more  
Let's call out names, names for sure  

_[Kanye West:]_  
On the bathroom wall I wrote  
"[[I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else]]"  
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"  
And I went and found somebody else  
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings  
Yo, I'd rather be by my fuckin' self  
'Til about 2 A.M. and I call back  
And I hang up and I start to blame myself  
Somebody help ^f25422

_[John Legend:]_  
Let's play the blame game, I love you more  
Let's play the blame game for sure  
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more  
Let's call out names, names for sure  

_[Kanye West:]_  
You weren't perfect, but you made life worth it  
Stick around, some real feelings might surface  
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom  
Grippin' you up, fuckin' and chokin' you  
What the hell was I supposed to do?  
I know you ain't gettin' this type of dick from that local dude  
And if you are, [[I hope you have a good time  'Cause I definitely be havin' mine|I hope you have a good time]]  
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine  
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional  
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you  
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you  
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?  
[[You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you]]  
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you  
1 A.M. and can't nobody get a hold of you  
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?  
Even though I knew he never told the truth  
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to  
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions  
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers  
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl  
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl  
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl  
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls"  
"[[5. All Of The Lights|All of the lights]]," she was caught in the hype, girl  
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie  
Now who to blame? You to blame?  
Me to blame? For the pain  
And it poured every time when it rained ^d19ee6

_[John Legend:]_  
Let's play the blame game, I love you more  
Let's play the blame game for sure  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Things used to be, now they not  
Anything but us is who we are  
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers  
We've become public enemies  
We walk away like strangers in the street  
Gone for eternity  
We erased one another  
So far from where we came  
With so much of everything  
How do we leave with nothing?  
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E  
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely  
Chloe Mitchell  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Let's play the blame game, I love you more  
Let's play the blame game for sure  
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more  
Let's call out names, names, for sure  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much  
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much  
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much  
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much  

_[Kanye West:]_  
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing  
And when the phone called, it just ring and ring  
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back  
And I heard the whole thing  
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing  

_[Chris Rock and Salma Kenas ("The Best Birthday"):]_  
Oh my God  
Baby, you done took this shit to another motherfuckin' level  
Now, a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this  
Goddamn, goddamn  
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?  
([[Yeezy taught me]])  
You never used to talk dirty, but now you goddamn disgusting  
My, my God, where'd you learn that?  
([[Yeezy taught me]])  
Look at you, motherfuckin' butt-ass-naked  
With them motherfuckin' Jimmy Choos on  
Who taught you how to put some motherfuckin' Jimmy Choos on?  
([[Yeezy taught me]])  
Yo, you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level  
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now, shit  
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay?  
And I-I-I-I, I love it, and I thank you  
I thank you, my dick thanks you  
How'd you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?  
([[Yeezy taught me]])  
I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before  
I was in there like, "Oh shit, I never been here before  
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before"  
It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit  
What the fuck happened?  
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?  
(Yeezy reupholstered my pussy)  
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy  
And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him  
I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker  
I'ma shoot a bootlegger  
That's how good I feel about this nigga  
Ah  
I still can't believe you got me this watch  
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted  
With the bezel? This is the motherfucker I wanted  
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source  
I 'member, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source  
That's right, that's right  
Yo, yo, babe, yo, yo, this the best birthday ever  
Where'd you learn to treat a nigga like this?  
([[Yeezy taught me]])  
Yeezy taught you well  
Yeezy taught you well
