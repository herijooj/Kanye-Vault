# Late

## Intro

Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha…)  
Please stop your crying  

## Chorus

I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that  
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that  
I'm comin' in when I feel like  
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right  
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that  
I think I was made for that  
So I'm comin' in when I feel like  
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right  

## Refrain

Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha…)  
Please stop your crying  

## Verse 1

Stop all your blood clot cryin', I was flyin'  
Made it to school with barely enough time to sign in  
Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear you, Mom  
Yeah, yeah, I don't wan' be broke when I'm thirty-one  
They said the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West  
There's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get  
Not even electives? Not even prerequisites?  
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?  
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'  
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'  
Man, this is an insult  
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow  
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo  
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro  
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?  
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh  

## Refrain

Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha…)  
Please stop your crying (Stop your cryin', baby)  

## Chorus

I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that  
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that  
I'm comin' in when I feel like  
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right  
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that  
I think I was made for that  
So I'm comin' in when I feel like  
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right  

## Refrain

Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha…)  
Please stop your crying  

## Verse 2

You know when you be late you miss all the lights  
That's right (that's right), that's right (that's right)  
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight  
That night (that night), that night  
Baby, it's too late for that, lately I've been taking it slow  
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close  
With the freshest hoes, the professors know  
We about to get real unprofessional  
Like them Eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?  
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?  
Hmm, I'll be on time for that  
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that  
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later?  
"I'll be there in five minutes," go 'head, ride with it  
I'm so live with it, look how I did it  
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it  
I know it's late and I took all year but  
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah  

## Outro

'Cause I'll erase away  
'Cause I'll erase away  
'Cause I'll erase away  
'Cause I'll erase away  
(A-ha-ha-ha-ha…)
