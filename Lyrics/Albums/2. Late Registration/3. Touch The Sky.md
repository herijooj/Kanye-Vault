# Touch The Sky (feat. Lupe Fiasco)

# Chorus: Kanye West

I gotta testify  
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly  
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky  
Gotta testify  
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly  
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky  

# Verse 1: Kanye West

Back when they thought [[Pink Polo|pink polos]] would hurt the Roc  
Before Cam got the shit to pop  
The doors was closed  
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks  
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan  
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van  
[[Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them]]  
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment  
Let's take 'em back to the club  
Least about an hour I stand on line  
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour  
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine  
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"  
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"  
A hip-hop legend  
I think I died in that accident, 'cause this must be Heaven ^61512a

# Chorus: Kanye West

I gotta testify  
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly  
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky  
Gotta testify  
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly  
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky  

# Post-Chorus: Kanye West

Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-igh  
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)  
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lah  
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)  
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-igh  
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)  
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lah  
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)  

# Verse 2: Kanye West

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock  
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop  
I'd do anything to say I got it  
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket  
Before anybody wanted K. West beats  
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC  
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns  
Like "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"  
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane  
And I don't know if I'll be back again  
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets  
But when she came to kick it, things became different  
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on  
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long  
[[I'm tryin' to right my wrongs]]  
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song ^3592c2

# Chorus: Kanye West

I gotta testify  
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly  
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky  
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify  
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly  
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky  

# Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco

Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?  
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd  
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb  
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge  
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup  
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth  
But, before you say another word  
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street  
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra  
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde  
Or touch√©, Lupe cool as the unthawed  
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge  
Come as correct as a porn star  
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car  
So, I represent the first  
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh  

# Chorus: Kanye West

I gotta testify  
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly  
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky  
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify  
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly  
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky  

# Outro: Kanye West

We back at home, baby!  
Sky high, I'm, I'm sky high!  
I'm, I'm sky high!  
I'm, I'm sky high!  
I'm, I'm sky high!  
I'm, I'm sky high!  
Sky, sky high! I'm, I'm sky high!  
Yeah, keep it rollin'!  
Yeah, uh, feels good to be home, baby!  
Feels good to be home!
