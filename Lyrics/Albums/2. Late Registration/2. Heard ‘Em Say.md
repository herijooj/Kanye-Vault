# Heard ‘Em Say (feat. Adam Levine)

## Intro

Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. West  
Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea  

# Verse 1: Kanye West

And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today  
From the [[Chi]], like Tim it's a harder way  
So this is in the name of love like Robert say  
Before you ask me to go get a job today  
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?  
[[And I know that the government administer AIDS]]  
So I guess we just pray like the minister say  
Allahu Akbar and throw in some hot cars  
Things we see on the screen that's not ours  
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far  
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars  
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars  
I guess they want us all behind bars – I know it ^dfd3bd

# Chorus: Kanye West & Adam Levine

Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today  
And I heard 'em say  
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)  
But we'll a find a way  
And nothing last forever but be honest babe  
It hurts but it may be the only way  

# Verse 2: Kanye West

They say people in your life are seasons  
And anything that happen is for a reason  
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing  
And Gran keep praying and keep believing  
In Jesus, and one day that you see him  
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him  
The devil is alive I feel him breathing  
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreaming  
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us  
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down  
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now  
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now  
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?  
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now  

# Chorus: Kanye West & Adam Levine

Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today  
And I heard 'em say  
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)  
But we'll a find a way  
And nothing last forever but be honest babe  
It hurts but it may be the only way  

# Post Chorus: Adam Levine

With every worthless word we get more far away  
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today  
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe  
It hurts but it may be the only way  
Oohh, oohh, oohh, oohh

# Outro: Kanye West

Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea
