# We Major (feat. Nas, Really Doe)

# Chorus: _[Really Doe:]_

You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up  
And watch how we roll up, and  
I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts  
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck  
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck  
But really what's [[4. Amazing|amazing]] is how I keep blazing  
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end  
Puff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation  
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser  
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior  
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper  
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper  
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major  

## Post Chorus: _[Kanye West:]_

We major? C'mon, homie, we major  
We major? C'mon, homie, we major  
We major! C'mon, homie, we major  
We major! C'mon  

## Verse 1: _[Kanye West:]_

Feeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon  
Better than a chick that say "Yes" too soon  
Until you have a daughter; that's what I call karma  
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon  
Projects tore up, gang signs is thrown up  
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up  
Why else you think [[Shorty|shorties]] write rhymes? Just to blow up?  
Get they first car and then, IRS show up  
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine  
Nigga come through flicking and he had that shine  
Put two and two together and a little bad weather  
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line  
Asked the reverend, "Was the strip clubs cool?  
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school?"  
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey  
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me  

## Chorus: _[Really Doe:]_

You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up  
And watch how we roll up, and  
I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts  
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck  
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck  
But really what's [[4. Amazing|amazing]] is how I keep blazing  
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end  
Puff puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation  
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser  
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior  
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper  
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper  
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major  

## Post Chorus: _[Nas:]_

We major? C'mon, homie, we major  
We major? C'mon, homie, we major  
We major! C'mon, homie, we major  
We major! C'mon, homie, we major  

## Verse 2: _[Nas:]_

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write  
First line—should it be about the hoes or the ice?  
Four-fours or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice  
Rap about big paper or the black man plight  
At the studio console, asked my man to the right  
"What this verse sound like? Should I freestyle or write?"  
He said, "Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still"  
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel  
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed  
Now, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time  
To build my very own Motown  
'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives  
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life  
And I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic  
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt  
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed  
I survived the livest niggas around  
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns  
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took  
Either way, my change came like Sam Cooke  

## Refrain: _[Tony Williams & Nas:]_

Ba-dop-ba-ba (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)  
Feeling better than I ever felt before today  
Like better late than never; it's orientation  
Still, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away  
Oh, oh, oh, ooh!  

## Chorus_[Really Doe & Tony Williams:]_

You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up  
And watch how we roll up, and (Ba-dop-ba-ba)  
I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts  
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck  
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck  
But really what's [[4. Amazing|amazing]] is how I keep blazing  
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end  
Puff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation  
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser (Oh, oh, oh, ooh!)  
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior (Ba-dop-ba-ba)  
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper  
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper  
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major  

## Post Chorus: _[Kanye West + Nas:]_

We major? (C'mon, homie, we major)

We major (C'mon, homie, we major)  
We major  

## Refrain: _[Tony Williams:]_

Oh, oh, oh, ooh! Ba-dop-ba-ba  
Feeling better than I ever felt before today  
But better late than never; it's orientation  
Still, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away  
Oh, oh, oh, ooh!  

## Interlude: _[Kanye West & Tony Williams:]_

[[Can I talk my shit again?]]  
[[Can I talk my shit again?]]  
I can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker  
I'ma be late, though  
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear  
Yeah  
The Roc is definitely in the building  
G.O.O.D. Music's definitely in the building, ugh  
I gotta say "What's up" to Tony Williams  
On the vocals!  
Sings—He sings quite beautifully, don't you agree?  
Don't you agree?  
Ugh  
And Jon Brion on the keys right now  
And Warryn Campbell on the keys right now  
So they asked me,  
"Why you call it [[Late Registration]], 'Ye?"  
'Cause we taking these motherfuckers back to school  
La, la, la, la-la-la-la la  
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along  
La la la la la, la-la-la ^9d5834

## Refrain: _[Tony Williams & Kanye West:]_

Ba-dop-bop-ba (Oh)  
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feeling good)  
But better late than never; it's orientation (It's orientation)  
But we can make it better, throwing all your cares away  

## Outro

We want you to get used to this  
Oh, oh, oh, ooh! Ba-dop-bop-ba
