# Wake Up Mr. West (feat. Bernie Mac)

## Skit: DeRay Davis

Oh, ho-ho-ho!  

I knew I was gon' see, I knew I was gon' see you again! Knew I was gon' see you again!  
Where your goddamn book bag at?  
Always carryin' that lil' book bag, nobody wants to see that!  
Goddamn 4th grader, sit your ass down!  
He wanna play it again like he got somethin' else to do  
You ain't got somethin' else to do!  
You ain't doin' nothin' wit' your life, notin' wit' your life!  
You think this is?  
You better look at me when I'm talkin' to you!  
You think this shit easy, don't you?  
You think this is promised!  
Well ain't nothin' promised to you!  
Look at my face, do I got a promised face?  
Does it look like I promised you anything?  
Kanye, nigga-is you snorin' in my class?  
Wake up Mr. West!  
Wake up Mr. West!
