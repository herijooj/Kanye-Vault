# Addiction

## Intro: Etta James

You make me smile with my heart, oh  

## Chorus : Kanye West & Etta James

Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?  
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would  
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could  
But you make me smile  

## Verse 1: Kanye West & Etta James

What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?  
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three  
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us  
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs  
(You make me smile)  
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious  
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush  
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be spontaneous  
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-co-coca-Cola  
(You make me smile with my heart, oh)  
Then I'm co-coming over 'cause it's ne-never over  

## Chorus : Kanye West & Etta James

Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?  
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would  
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could  
But you make me smile  

## Verse 2: Kanye West & Etta James

I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show  
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown  
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go  
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed (You make me smile)  
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose  
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose  
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed  
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-co-coca Cola  
(You make me smile with my heart)  
And I keep co-coming over 'cause it's ne-never over ^3a64bd

## Outro : Kanye West & Etta James

I just wanted to ask you  
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this uh  
Let's say all your friends, remember the one  
You said if you ever she would be the one  
OK, OK, OK (You make me smile with my heart)  
Well I was thinking, hypothetically  
I mean don't take this seriously  
Don't take me: I mean just, uh, not credibly  
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean let it be  
I just let it be  
I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart)  
I mean you, her and me  
Maybe, baby, baby  
You know I was just kidding  
Unless you gon' do it (You make me smile)
