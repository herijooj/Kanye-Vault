# Bring Me Down (feat. Brandy)

## Chorus: Brandy

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down  
Way down, way down  
One day, they'd tried to bring me down  
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down  
Way down, they'd try to bring me down  

## Verse: Kanye West

We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray  
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say  
Since Pac passed away  
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me  
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything  
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream  
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is  
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids  
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive  
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive  
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time  
Make it out of this [[Grind]], 'fore I'm out of my mind  
And get some leeway on the "he say, she say"  
[[Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?]]  
Spanish girls say, "Yo, no hablo ingl√©s."  
And everybody want to run to me for their single  
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help  
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself  
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself  
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself!  
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself  
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help  
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'  
[[Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something]] ^e1e353

## Bridge: Brandy

What you calling?  
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya  
What kind of dream we found?  
See, I'm often catching crosswinds  
Forgetting where the hell I met you  
And try to bring me down  

## Chorus: Brandy

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down  
Way down, way down  
One day, they'd tried to bring me down  
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down  
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
