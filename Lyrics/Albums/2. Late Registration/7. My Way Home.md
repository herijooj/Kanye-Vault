# My Way Home (feat. Common)

# Intro: Common & Gil Scott-Heron

Yeah  
I'm on my way home

## Verse: Common

Yeah  
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is  
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas  
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses  
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses  
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles  
Rubber band together in cashless bundles  
We wear struggling chains, divided only hustle remains  
Making sense of it we hustle for change  
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fighting  
Some wanna stay in their corner like Mike Tyson  
Hypes fighting for hits to heighten they hell  
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?  
Show money becomes bail, relationships become [[2. Jail|jail]]  
Children are unheld  
I wish love was for sale, "Behold the Pale Horse"  
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it  

# Outro: Gil Scott-Heron

Might not be such a bad idea if I never  
Never went home again  
I'm on my way home  
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone  
Home is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it  
Might not be such a bad idea if I never  
Never went home again
