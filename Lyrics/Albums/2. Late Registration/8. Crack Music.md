# Crack Music (feat. The Game)

## Chorus Kanye West, The Game, & Choir

That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)  
That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)

## Verse 1: Kanye West

How we stop the Black Panthers?  
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer  
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'  
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin  
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland  
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched  
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since  
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine  
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it  
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if  
That's that good shit, we ain't sure man  
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man

## Chorus Kanye West, The Game, & Choir

That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)  
That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)

## Verse 2: Kanye West

From the place where the father's gone  
The mothers is hardly home  
And the Madigan's lock us up in the Audy Home  
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes  
They wanna pack us all in a box like Styrofoam  
Who gave Saddam anthrax?  
[[George Bush]] got the answers  
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical  
Arm and Hammer baking soda raised they own quota  
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause  
'Cause, dreams of being Hova  
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman  
[[To bein' the President, look there's hope man]]  
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man  
[[Shorty]] come and see his momma straight overdosin'  
And this is the soundtrack  
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that— ^545a80

## Chorus Kanye West, The Game, & Choir

Crack music nigga

## Outro: Malik Yusef

Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread  
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread  
See I done did all this old bullshit  
And to atone, I throw a little somethin' somethin' on the pulpit  
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit  
And what we gave back was crack music  
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies  
So our mommas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies  
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny  
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys  
This dark diction has become America's [[11. Addiction |addiction]]

Those who ain't even black use it  
We gon' keep baggin' up this here crack music
