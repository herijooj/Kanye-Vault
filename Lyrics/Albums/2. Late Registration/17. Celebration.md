# Celebration

## Chorus

Yeah, you know what this is  
It's a celebration, bitches!  
Grab a drink, grab a glass  
After that I grab yo ass  

## Verse 1

Why you actin' all… shy and all?  
Why is y'all… lyin' for?  
"I never did this before…" Stop that  
What, you want some Patron? I got that  
I mean I promise y'all, you fine and all  
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw  
But she not like you  
No, she not like you  
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue  
All that [[4. TALKING|talking]] is gon' give me a Tylenol  
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all  
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off  

## Pre Chorus

But, I just thought you should know  
We hit the liquor store  
Got some Cris' and some Mo'  
And we about to let it flow, oh, oh  
Had some problems before  
But see we let em go  
Got an ounce of that 'dro  
And we about to let it blow, oh, oh  

## Chorus

Yeah, you know what this is  
It's a celebration, bitches!  
Grab a drink, grab a glass  
After that I grab yo ass  

## Verse 2

See you know my style, I'm very wild  
And I vow that my child will be well endowed  
Like his daddy  
And tell him that your mama had a fattie  
He looked up at me  
Said, "Daddy, that's the reason why you had me?"  
Yep, we was practicing  
'Til one day your ass bust through the packaging  
You know what though? You my favorite accident  
So go head pop some Cristal for my newborn child  

## Chorus

'Cause now y'all know what this is  
It's a celebration, bitches!  
Grab a drink, grab a glass  
After that I grab yo ass  

## Post Chorus

But, I just thought you should know  
We hit the liquor store  
Got some Cris' and some Mo'  
And we about to let it flow, oh, oh  
Had some problems before but see we let em go  
Got an ounce of that 'dro  
And we about to let it blow, oh  

## Outro

Oh, oh!  
We lookin' for some hoes, hoes!  
Ow!
