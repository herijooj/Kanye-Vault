I brought you brothers here today to start our own fraternity  
Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it  
Broke Phi Broke (we ain't got it)  
No, we have no money  
We are sharin' jeans  
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on  
How many cars do we own? (None!)  
How many cars do we own? (None, sir!)  
Should we let our women go and be with the cat with the car?  
(Yes, we will!)  
Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me!  
(We can't afford no gas!)  
Say it!  
(We can't afford no gas!)
