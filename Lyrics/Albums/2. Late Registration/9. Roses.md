# Roses

# Verse 1: Kanye West

I know it's past visiting hours  
But can I please give her these flowers?  
The doctor don't wanna take procedures  
He claim her heart can't take the anaesthesia  
It'll send her body into a seizure  
That little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beeping  
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words  
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?  
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'  
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'  
I'm arguin' like what kind of doctor can we fly in  
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid  
If Magic Johnson got a cure for [[And I know that the government administer AIDS|AIDS]]  
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away  
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA  
Right now she'd be OK? But since she  
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years  
Things 'sposed to stop right here  
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he's strong  
That's where I get my confidence from  
I asked the nurse, "Did you do the research?"  
She asked me, "Can you sign some T-shirts?"  
Bitch, is you smoking reefer?  
You don't see that we hurt? But stillâ€“ ^6f3c08

I smile, when Rosie comes to see me  
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)  
Can't wait for the clouds to break  

# Verse 2: Kanye West

They're outside of the emergency room, room  
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat  
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon  
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep  
My momma say they say she could pass away any day  
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?  
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt  
Cousin Kim took off of work  
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean  
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team  
Feel like Amerie, it's just "One Thing"  
When they said that she made it you see their eyes gleam  
I think we at a all-time high  
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive  
'Cause with my family we know where home is  
And so instead of sending flowers, we the roses

I, smile, when Rosie comes to see me  
And I'm sad when Rosie goes away  
'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (Say)  

# Outro: _Patti LaBelle_

Can't wait, I can't wait, no  
Can't wait, I can't wait, no  
Can't wait, I, can't wait  
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day  
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break  
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm  
Oh oh oh oh no no, say  
Tellin' you the truth now  
Said I can't wait, uh-uh  
I won't wait, no
