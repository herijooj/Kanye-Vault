# Heavy Hitters

# Intro: Kanye West

Heavy hitters fo' life  
Heavy hitters fo' life  
Mm, mm  
Mm-mm

## Verse 1: Kanye West

You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit  
Wanna be on my album, but don't want me on they shit

Everybody thought I was making a compilation  
I was really making myself they compe-tation

Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game  
Bone girls on TV, so it's All-Star trains  
Just picture, man (Uh-huh), no snitchin', man (Uh-uh)  
Something for the fiends fresh out the kitchen, man  
Last 9/11, I was poor on the ave', 'til I pluraled my math  
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm flooring the gas (Errr!)

Got a lot of problems, money's one that I not have (No more, ugh)  
Well, Dame look at how everybody changed  
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game  
Tell Biggs that we about to get paid  
All my niggas is 'bout to have it made  
This makes everything else sound played  
"Goddamn, Kanye!" ("Kanye! Kanye!")  
Now hold up! Ain't nobody messing with me, dog  
Now, you say it! ("Ain't nobody messin' with you at all!")  
I told dude, "You can't even rap on my interlude"  
Now, does that make me as rude as Jude?

("When the album coming out?") Man, the people is asking

Yamamoto, Adidas, he's sick with the fashion  
You already got dough, so you spit for the passion (Ugh)  
The way you rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks  
And let's not even bring up the tracks, man  
Nope, nope, let's not do that, man  
You eating up the game like Pac-Man  
And got the whole world shaking just like crack fiends

## Chorus: Kanye West

Heavy hitters, fo' life (Woo!)  
Roc-a-Fella is fo' life  
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up  
Throw your diamonds (Just let the beat ride out for a minute)

## Interlude: GLC &Kanye West

Let's take it there, take it there, man  
Champ 'posed to be, GLC  
Can't be the champ, you ugly  
_GLC, where you at homie?_

## Verse 2: GLC

How many niggas you know that put their life on the line  
To get signed? Did a few high crimes, almost had lights-out  
After the sunshine, you thinking it might count  
How could I might doubt? Just look at my account

I used to work at the mall with nothing at all  
Seeing niggas that ball, that shit was depressing

Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressing  
When I copped them pounds, it was my best investments  
Dre got shot (Aww) and that taught me a lesson  
For stickin' niggas up in them robbery masses  
Mask like Batman, minus the tight pants  
Would hit your baby momma, but her elbows is ashy (Uh-uh)  
Four different blues, man, your outfit is clashing (Ha!)  
You ain't got no muscles, you weak, lame bastard (Haha)  
Man, look at your haircut  
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, naw, your hair sucks  
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters?  

'87 Go-Getters, two hoes like John Ritter

Even did it on his crime picture and yeah (Ugh, ugh, ugh)  
And offers to sell and yell, ugh

## Chorus: Kanye West

Heavy hitters fo' life  
Roc-A-Fella is fo' life  
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up  
Throw your diamonds

## Outro: Rude Jude

Yo, what up?  
This is Rude motherfuckin' Jude  
A.K.A "The Tapioca Stroker"  
A.K.A "The J-Man"  
A.K.A "Rascal Lovato"  
A.K.A "That guy"  
Think about it  
Now I-  
I'm over here chillin' with Kanye 'cause we got a lot in common, you know what I'm sayin'?  
He got a unique style, I got a style of my own  
I've been listening to the radio and shit and I've been hearing a lot of high pitch singy songs on the background  
I'm like, yo, "Yo, Kanye, that's your shit, that's your shit!"  
He's like, "Nah dawg"  
So you you don't gotta be a mathematician or a muhfucking marine biologist to figure this shit out  
Motherfuckers is bitin'  
So please, do yourself and everybody else a favor  
Take that style that you had  
Put it in an UPS package and send it back to Kanye's house 'cause he want his style back
