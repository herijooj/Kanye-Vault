# We Don't Care

## Intro: Kanye West

Oh, yeah  
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing  
And all my people that's—  

## Chorus: Kanye West

Drug dealin' just to get by  
Stack your money 'til it get [[3. Touch The Sky|sky high]]  
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five  
Joke's on you, we still alive  
Throw your hands up in the sky and say  
"We don't care what people say"  

## Verse 1: Kanye West

If this is your first time hearing this  
You are about to experience something so cold, man  
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted  
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man  
[[But as a shorty]], I looked up to the dope man  
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man  
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man  
We don't care what people say  
This is for my niggas outside all winter  
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, "Next summer, I'm finna…"  
Sitting in the hood like community colleges  
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship  
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no [[ambition]]  
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home  
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job  
You gotta do something, man, your ass is grown ^232df0

## Chorus: Kanye West with Choir

Drug dealin' just to get by  
Stack your money 'til it get sky high  
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)  
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five  
Joke's on you, we still alive  
Throw your hands up in the sky and say  
"We don't care what people say"  

## Verse 2: Kanye West

This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle  
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55  
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's  
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up  
We put shit on lay-away, then come back  
We claim other people kids on our income tax  
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid  
And we don't care what people say  
Mama say she wanna move South  
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house  
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house  
Couldn't get a job  
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work  
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight  
So [[Niggas' Money is Homo]], it's hard to get straight  
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake  
And we don't care what people say, my niggas— ^781757

## Chorus: Kanye West with Choir

Drug dealin' just to get by (Yeah)  
Stack your money 'til it get sky high  
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!  
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five  
Joke's on you, we still alive (Alive, uh-huh)  
Throw your hands up in the sky and say  
"We don't care what people say" (Yeah, yeah, ugh)  

## Verse 3: Kanye West

You know the kids gon' act a fool  
When you stop the programs for after school  
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic  
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions"  
We scream, "Rocks, blow, weed, park," see, now we smart  
We ain't retards the way teachers thought  
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash  
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class  
It's bad enough we on welfare  
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair  
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here  
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here  
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us  
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance  
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us  
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—  

## Chorus: Kanye West with Choir

Drug dealin' just to get by  
Stack your money 'til it get sky high  
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!  
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five  
Joke's on you, we still alive  
Throw your hands up in the sky and say  
"We don't care what people say"
