# The New Workout Plan

## Intro

You just popped in the Kanye West  
Get Right for the Summer workout tape  
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly  
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player  
Man, at least a dude with a car  
So, first of all, we gon' work on the stomach  
Nobody wants a little tight ass  

## Verse 1

1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and get them sit ups right, and  
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this  
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave  
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed  
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed  
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited  
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick  
(Ah!) What's scary to me is  
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me  
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name  
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came ^9be617

## Chorus

It's been a week without me  
And she feel weak without me  
She wanna talk it out but  
Ain't nothing to talk about  
Unless she talk about freaking out  
Then maybe we can work it out  
Work it out, work it out  
Work it out, work it out now  
Maybe we can work it out  

## Verse 2

Oh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette  
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said "Get It Wet"  
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!  
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS  
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars  
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars  
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat  
Maybe one day girl we can bone  
So you can brag to all your homies now  
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit girl, I'll still hit girl  
1 and, you brought 2 friends, OK, 3 more now hop in the Benz  
4-door: do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8?  
All the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates  
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating  
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas  

## Chorus

It's been a week without me  
And she feel weak without me  
She wanna talk it out but  
Ain't nothing to talk about  
Unless she talk about freaking out  
Then maybe we can work it out  
Work it out, work it out  
Work it out, work it out now  
Maybe we can work it out  

## Interlude: Jill, Lasandra, Ella-May & Kanye West

Hi, my name is Jill, I just want to say thanks to Kanye's workout plan. I  
Was able to pull a NBA player. And like now I shop every day on Rodeo  
Drive. I just want to say, thank you Kanye! Woooo! Woooo! Woooo!  

My name is Lasandra, and I just want to say that ever since listening to  
Kanye's workout tape, I was able to get my phone bill paid, I got sounds  
And 13's put up in my Cavalier and I was able to get a free trip to  
Cancun. And what's most importantly is that I ain't gotta fuck with  
Ray-Ray's broke ass no more  

Work it (more)  
Juke it (more) Pump it (more)  
[[Chi-Town]] (more) Let's go (more)  

My name is Ella-May from Mobile, Alabama, and I just want to say since  
Listening to Kanye's workout tape, I been able to date outside the family,  
I got a double wide, and I rode a plane, rode a plane, rode a plane  

Thanks to Kanye's workout plan  
I'm the envy of all my friends  
See I pulled me a baller man  
And I ain't gotta work at the mall again
