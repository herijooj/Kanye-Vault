# School Spirit (Skit 1)

## Skit 1: DeRay Davis

Now beat that!  
And your mother's saying "Go to college"  
So you finish college and it's wonderful  
You feel so good  
And after all the partying and craziness  
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around your peers  
Hey!  
Now you'll get that 25-thous job a year  
And you'll spend all your money on crack cocaine  
But, it'll be your money  
No more borrowing from mom for my high!  
So now you get your degree tattooed on your back you're so excited about it  
If you continue to work at the Gap, after several interviews, oh my God  
You'll come in at a entry-level position  
And when you do that  
If you kiss enough ass  
You'll move up to the next level  
Which is being a secretary's secretary  
And boy is that great  
You get to take messages for the secretary  
Who never went to college  
She's actually the boss's niece!  
So now you're part of the family  
You know what college does for you?  
It makes you really smart, man  
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class  
Not me, I listened  
OK?  
I was a hall monitor  
This was meant to be  
You know how many classes I took?  
Extra classes, extra classes  
No, I've never had sex  
But you know what?  
My degree keeps me satisfied  
When a lady walks up to me and says  
"Hey, you know what's sexy?"  
I say no, I don't know what it is  
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse very fast
