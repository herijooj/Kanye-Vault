# Two Words

## Chorus: Kanye West

We in the streets, playa, get ya mail  
It's only two places you end up, either dead or in [[2. Jail|jail]]  
Still nowhere to go  
Still nowhere to go  
Now throw ya hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes  
Everybody, fuck that  
Still nowhere to go  
Still nowhere to go  

## Verse 1: Yasiin Bey

Two words, United States, no love, no breaks  
Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks  
Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules  
Presidential scandals, everybody move  
Two words, Mos Def, K. West, hot shit  
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this  
Game 'pon lock shit, gun 'pon cock shit  
We won't stop shit, everybody move  
Two words, BK, NY, Bed Stuy  
Too harsh, too hungry, too many, that's why  
These streets know game, can't ball, don't play  
Heavy traffic, one lane, everybody move  
Two words, Mos Def, Black Jack, hot shit  
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this  
Game 'pon lock, gun 'pon cock  
We won't stop, everybody move  

## Chorus: Kanye West & Harlem Boys Choir

Now throw ya hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes  
(Throw your hands up high) Everybody, fuck that  
Still nowhere to go  
Still nowhere to go  
And keep ya hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters  
Hoes ('Til they reach the sky), everybody, fuck that  
Still nowhere to go  
Still nowhere to go  

## Verse 2: Kanye West

Two words: [[Chicago|Chi-Town]], Southside, worldwide  
'Cause I rep that 'til I fuckin' die  
One neck, two chains, one waist, two gats  
One wall, twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that  
[[I Am Limelight]], Blueprint, five mics  
Go-Getters rhyme, like, should've been signed twice  
Most imitated, Grammy-nominated  
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated  
Barbershop playa-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it  
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in  
Two words: [[Chicago|Chi-Town]] raised me, crazy  
So I live by two words: "Fuck you, pay me"  
Screaming, "Jesus, save me!"  
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me  
'Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me  
Look, God, it's the same me  
And I basically know now, we get racially profiled  
'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down  
Plus, I got a whole city to hold down  
From the bottom, so the top's the only place to go now ^196ac0

## Chorus: Kanye West & Harlem Boys Choir

Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes  
(Throw your hands up high)  
Oh, everybody, fuck that  
Still nowhere to go  
Still nowhere to go  

## Verse 3: Freeway

Two words, Freeway, two letters, AR  
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words: fast runners  
Like Jackie Joyner, you better sleep with your burner  
The heat skeet, blow a reef through your car, my God  
Two words: no guns, break arms  
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal  
Free, young boss, freshman of the Roc  
With the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs to brawl  
Forget your squad, better fend for yourself  
Have you screamin' out four words, "Send for the law?" ugh  
Two words: Freeway, slightly retarded  
Fuck around, throw a clip in your artist, leave with his broad  

## Outro: Yasiin Bey & Harlem Boys Choir

Red, white, blue, black (Throw your hands up)  
Calm down, move back  
Motherfuckers asking, "Who is that?"  
You know it's the almighty Black Jack  
Mos Def, K. West  
Ghetto people get this shit off ya chest  
North to the south, to the east, to the west  
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest  
(High) And show it to 'em like
