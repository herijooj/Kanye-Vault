# I’ll Fly Away

## Verse: The World Famous Tony Williams & DeRay Davis

One glad morning when this life is over,  
I'll fly away.  
To a land where joy shall never end,  
I'll fly away.  

## Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams & DeRay Davis

I'll fly away, O Glory,  
I'll fly away.  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,  
I'll fly away.
