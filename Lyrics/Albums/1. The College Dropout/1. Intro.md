## Intro: DeRay Davis

Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?  
Me and the other faculty members was wonderin'  
Could you do a lil' som—  
Somethin' beautiful, somethin' that the kids is gon' love when they hear it  
That's gon' make them start jumpin' up and down, and sharin' candy and stuff  
Think you could probably do somethin', for the kids, for [[Graduation]] to sing?
