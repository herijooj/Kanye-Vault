# All Falls Down (feat. Syleena Johnson)

## Chorus: Syleena Johnson and Kanye West

Oh, when it all, it all falls down  
Yeah, this the real one, baby  
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down  
Uh, [[Chicago|Chi-Town]], stand up!  
Oh, when it all, it all falls down  
Southside, Southside  
We gon' set this party off right  
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down  
Westside, Westside  
We gon' set this party off right  
Oh, when it all

## Verse 1: Kanye West

Man, I promise, she's [[So Self Conscious]]  
She has no idea what she doin' in college  
That major that she majored in don't make no money  
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny  
Now, tell me that ain't insecure  
The concept of school seems so secure  
Sophomore, three years, ain't picked a carrier  
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair."  
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs  
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care  
She's so precious with the peer pressure  
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis  
She had hair so long that it looked like weave  
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve  
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe  
Single black female addicted to retail, and well ^d923f7

## Chorus: Syleena Johnson and Kanye West

Oh, when it all, it all falls down  
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?  
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down  
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down  
Oh, when it all

## Verse 2: Kanye West

Man, I promise, I'm [[So Self Conscious]]  
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches  
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy  
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!  
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this  
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this."  
And I can't even go to the grocery store  
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team  
It seem we livin' the American Dream  
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem  
The prettiest people do the ugliest things  
For the road to riches and diamond rings  
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us  
We tryna buy back our 40 acres  
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop  
Even if you in a [[Benz]], you still a nigga in a coupe ^6fa44c

## Chorus: Syleena Johnson and Kanye West

Oh, when it all, it all falls down  
Come on, come on  
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down  
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?  
Oh, when it all, it all falls down  
Come on, come on  
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down  
And when it all falls down

## Verse 3: Kanye West

I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em  
We buy our way out of [[2. Jail|jail]], but we can't buy freedom  
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em  
Things we buy to cover up what's inside  
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth  
That's why [[Shorty]]'s hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"  
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack  
And the white man get [[3. PAID|paid]] off of all of that  
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou  
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou  
Before I had a house and I'd [[7. DO IT|do it]] again  
'Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park, pushin' a [[Benz]]  
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific  
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific  
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it  
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it ^b130ba

## Chorus: Syleena Johnson and Kanye West

Oh, when it all, it all falls down  
C'mon, c'mon  
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?  
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down  
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down  
Oh, when it all, it all falls down  
Southside, Southside  
We gon' set this party off right  
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down  
Westside, Westside  
We gon' set this party off right  
Oh when it all, it all falls down  
[[Chicago|Chi-Town]], [[Chicago|Chi-Town]]  
We gon' show 'em how we get down  
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down  
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life  
C'mon  
Oh when it all, it all falls down  
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
