## Verse 1

I'ma get on this TV, mama  
I'ma, I'ma put shit down  
I'ma make sure these [[Light Skinned Friend|light-skinned]] niggas

Never, ever, never come back in style  
Told 'em I finished school and I started my own business  
They say, "Oh you [[Graduation|graduated]]?" No, I decided I was finished  
Chasing y'all dreams and what you've got planned  
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned  
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there  
Everything I want, I gotta wait a year, I wait a year  
This nigga [[Graduation|graduated]] at the top of our class  
I went to Cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there

## Verse 2

I got a Jones like Norah for your soror-  
Bring more of them girls, I've seen in The Aurora  
Tammy, Becky, and Laura, or a Shirley  
I'm trying to hit it early, like I'm in a hurry  
See, that's how dude became the young Pootie Tang: "tippy tow"  
Roc-A-Fella chain, yeah that's my rapper style  
Rosary piece, yeah that's my Catholic style  
Red and white Ones, yeah that's my Kappa style  
And I ain't even pledge  
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead  
If I could go through all that and still be breathing  
Bitch, bend over, I'm here for a reason
