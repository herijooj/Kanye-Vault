# Send It Up (feat. King L)

_[Beenie Man:]_  
Relivin' the past?  
Your loss!  

_[King Louie:]_  
Rockstar, bitch, call me Elvis  
M.O.B., she call me selfish  
Success got 'em jealous  
[[Shorty]]'s killin', while I'm drillin'  
Tattoos, how they break the news  
It was real if you made the news  
Last night, my bitches came in twos  
And they both sucked like they came to lose  
Dropped out the first day of school  
'Cause niggas got cocaine to move  
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove  
Killin' 'em, honey how I make the pain improve  

_[King Louie:]_  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  

_[Kanye West:]_  
This the cray-ist shit in the club  
Since "In Da Club"  
It's so packed I might ride around  
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club  
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"  
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"  
If not, treat your friends like my Benz  
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end  
When I go raw, I like to leave it in  
When I wake up, I like to go again  
When I go to work, she gotta call it in  
She can't go to work, same clothes again  
And her heart colder than the souls of men  
Louboutin on the toes again  
Tight dress dancin' close to him  
[[Yeezus]] just rose again  

_[King Louie:]_  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  
We can send this bitch up, it can go down  

_[Beenie Man:]_  
Memories don't leave like people do  
They always 'member you  
Whether things are good or bad  
It's just the memories that you have  
Memories don't leave like people do  
They always 'member you  
Whether things are good or bad  
It's just the memories that you have
