# Bound 2 (feat. Charlie Wilson)

_[Ponderosa Twins Plus One and Brenda Lee:]_  
B-B-B-B-Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love  
Uh-huh, honey  

_[Kanye West:]_  
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now  
When a real nigga hold you down, you s'posed to drown  

_[Ponderosa Twins Plus One, Brenda Lee and Kanye West:]_  
Bound to fall in love (Bound)  
B-B-B-B-Bound to fall in love (Bound)  
Uh-huh, honey  

_[Kanye West:]_  
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?  
She say she only here for her girl birthday  
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty  
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty  
I know I got a bad reputation  
Walking-round-always-mad reputation  
[[Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation]]  
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation  
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement  
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'  
How you gon' be mad on vacation?  
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans  
Uh, this that prom shit  
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit  
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit  
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch   ^d45df0

_[Charlie Wilson and Brenda Lee:]_  
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'  
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)  

_[Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One and Brenda Lee:]_  
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures  
[[One good girl is worth a thousand bitches]]  
Bound (Bound to fall in love)  
Bound (Bound to fall in love)  
Uh-huh, honey   ^a98227

_[Kanye West:]_  
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink  
After that, give you somethin' to drink  
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink  
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?  
Hey, you remember where we first met?  
Okay, I don't remember where we first met  
But hey, admittin' is the first step  
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect  
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep  
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect  
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'  
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas  
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist  
[[Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?]]  
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps  
But first, you gon' remember how to forget  
After all these long-ass verses  
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept   ^5259ae

_[Charlie Wilson and Brenda Lee:]_  
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'  
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody  
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party  
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody  
Uh-huh, honey  

_[Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One, and Brenda Lee:]_  
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth  
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound  
Uh-huh, honey
