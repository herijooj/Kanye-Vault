# Guilt Trip (feat. Kid Cudi)

_[Kanye West:]_  
I need to call it off  
I need to, I need to make it known  
'Nother one, something gone  
Capricorn  
Dancing out on the lawn  
Fancy like the things she likes  
She lives her life  
I'm living mine  

_[Popcaan:]_  
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan  
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, sof-sof-softer sof-softer  
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan  
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, softer than clay  

_[Kanye West:]_  
[[Maybe it's 'cause she into Leos and I was into trios]]  
Plus all the trips to Rio couldn't have helped  
It's gettin' cold, better bring your ski clothes  
Peekin' through the keyhole, the door locked by myself  
And I'm feelin' it right now  
'Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down  
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka  
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka  
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted  
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka  
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba  
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa  
On to the next saga  
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her  
Star Wars fur, yeah, I'm rockin' Chewbacca  
The one Chief Rocka, number-one Chief Rocka   ^3081b7

_[Popcaan:]_  
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan  
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, sof-sof-softer sof-softer  
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan  
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, softer than clay  

_[Popcaan:]_  
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray  
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK  

_[Kid Cudi:]_  
Ohh, ohh, ohh  
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?  
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?  
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?  
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, hmm  
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?  
Let me go, let me go, hmm  

_[Popcaan:]_  
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan

All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
