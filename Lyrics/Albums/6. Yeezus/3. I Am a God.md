Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt  
And now she find out what life is really worth  
No to X rated  
I am a god  
I am a god  
I am a god  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I am a god  
Hurry up with my damn massage  
Hurry up with my damn ménage  
Get the Porsche out the damn garage  
I am a god  
[[Even though I'm a man of God]]  
My whole life in the hand of God  
So y'all better quit playin' with God   ^270d28

_[Kanye West:]_  
[[Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you]]  
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you  
The only rapper compared to Michael  
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you  
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you  
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do  
Old niggas mentally still in high school  
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you  
[[Pink Polo|Pink-ass polos]] with a fuckin' [[backpack]]  
But everybody know you brought real rap back  
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack  
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback  
Ibn diamond, [[Chi-Town]] shinin'  
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate  
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment  
Until the day I get struck by lightning   ^ad36de

_[Kanye West:]_  
I am a god  
So hurry up with my damn massage  
In a French-ass restaurant  
Hurry up with my damn croissants  
I am a god  
I am a god  
I am a god  

_[Kanye west:]_  
I just talked to Jesus  
He said, "What up, [[Yeezus]]?"  
I said, "Shit—I'm chillin'  
Tryna stack these millions"  
I know he the most high  
But I am a close high  
Mi casa, su casa  
That's our cosa nostra  
I am a god  
I am a god  
I am a god  

_[Justin Vernon:]_  
Ain't no way I'm givin' up, I'm a god
