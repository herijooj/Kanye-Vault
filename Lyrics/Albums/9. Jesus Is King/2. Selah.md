# Selah

_[Kanye West:]_  
[[8. God Is|God is]] King, we the soldiers  
[[1. Ultralight Beam|Ultrabeam]] out the solar  
When I get to Heaven's gates  
I ain't gotta peek over  
Keepin' perfect composure  
When I scream at the chauffeur  
I ain't mean, I'm just focused  
I ain't mean, I'm just focused  
Pour the lean out slower  
Got us clean out of soda  
Before the flood, people judge  
They did the same thing to Noah  
Everybody wanted [[Yandhi]]  
Then [[Jesus Christ did the laundry]]  
They say the week start on Monday  
But the strong start on Sunday  
Won't be in bondage to any man  
John 8:33  
We the descendants of Abraham  
[[Ye should be made free]]  
John 8:36  
To whom the son set free is free indeed  
He saved a wretch like me   ^4b11cb

_[Kanye West:]_  
If you woke, then wake up  
With Judas, kiss and make up  
Even with the bitter cup  
Forgave my brothers and drank up  
Did everything but gave up  
Stab my back, I can't front  
Still we win, we prayed up  
Even when we die, we raise up (Hallelujah)  
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it  
The powers that be done been greedy  
We need ours by this evening  
No white flag or no treaty  
We got the product, we got the tools  
We got the minds, we got the youth  
We goin' wild, we on the loose  
People is lying, we are the truth  
Everything old shall now become new  
The leaves'll be green, bearing the fruit  
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke  
The army of God and we are the truth  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo  
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo  
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo  
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo
