# On God

Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre  

"How you get so much favor on your side?"  
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied  
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide  
I'ma ride, that's on God  
His light shine the brightest in the dark  
Single mothers know they got my heart  
And all my brothers locked up on the yard  
You can still be anything you wanna be  
Went from one in four to one in three  
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me  
He the new commander and the chief  
That's on Keef, that's on God  
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage  
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage  
They had me chasin' statues, that's on [[pride]]
"Oh my God," Bust said that's on Tribe  
When I thought the Book of Job was a job  
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie  
Life gon' have some lows and some highs  
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod  
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide  
In '03, they told me not to drive  
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died  
But I survived, that's on God  
I've been tellin' y'all since '05  
The greatest artist restin' or alive  
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive  
That's no Jive, that's on God  
Off the 350s He supplied  
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe  
Man, that's over half of the pie  
I felt dry, that's on God  
That's why I charge the prices that I charge  
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars  
No, I cannot let my family starve  
I go hard, that's on God  

(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)  
Okay, okay, okay, okay
