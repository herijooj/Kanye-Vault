# Closed on Sunday

Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fil-A  
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A  
Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away  
Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray  
When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe  
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate  
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A  
You're my number one, with the lemonade  
Raise our sons, train them in the faith  
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake  
Follow Jesus, listen and obey  
No more livin' for the culture, [[Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave|we nobody's slave]]  

Stand up for my home  
Even if I take this walk alone  
I bow down to the King upon the throne  
My life is His, I'm no longer my own  
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand  
They will think twice steppin' onto my land  
I draw the line, it's written in the sand  
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'  
Now, back up off my family, move your hands  
I got my weapons in the spirit's land  
I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance  
Jezebel don't even stand a chance
