Father, I stretch  
[[2. Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1|Stretch my hands to You]]

Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right  
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite  
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike  
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?  
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes  
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't [[Christ-like]]"  
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike  
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like  
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)  
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light  
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't [[Christ-like]]"  
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ  
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me  
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET  
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free  
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece  
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light  
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't [[Christ-like]]" (Stretch my hands to You)  
I'm just tryna find, I've been lookin' for a new way  
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way  
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though  
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though  
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)  
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle  
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)  
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't [[Christ-like]]"  

Man  
You know, it's like  
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your  
I be on my  
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers  
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)  
Give him some advice, he starts [[spaz|spazzin]]' on me  
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't [[Christ-like]]"  
I said, "Ah"
