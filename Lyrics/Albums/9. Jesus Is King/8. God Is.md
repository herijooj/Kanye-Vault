# God Is

God is  
My light in darkness, oh  
God, God is  
He, He is my all and all (And I'll never turn back)  
God is  

Everything that hath breath praise the Lord  
Worship Christ with the best of your portions  
I know I won't forget all He's done  
He's the strength in this race that I run  
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness  
And it shows just how much He is miraculous  
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still  
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed  
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store  
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door  
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name  
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane  
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up  
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup  
I know God is alive, yeah  
He has opened up my [[She saw the vision|vision]]
Giving me a revelation  
This ain't 'bout a dead religion  
Jesus brought a revolution  
All the captives are forgiven  
Time to break down all the prisons  
Every man, every woman  
There is freedom from addiction  
Jesus, You have my soul  
Sunday Service on a roll  
All my idols, let 'em go  
All the demons, let 'em know  
This a mission, not a show  
This is my eternal soul  
This my kids, this the crib  
This my wife, this my life  
This my God-given right  
Thank You, Jesus, won the fight  

That's what God is  
That's what God is  
That's what God is
