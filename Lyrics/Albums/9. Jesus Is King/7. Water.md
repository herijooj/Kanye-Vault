# Water (feat. Ant Clemons)

_[Kanye West:]_  
Well, right  
So, so well  
Well, right  
So, so  
High as the sun come out  
Plannin'  
Bootin'  
Plannin'  
Movin'  
Plannin'  
Tubin', there  
Well, well  

_[Ant Clemons:]_  
Clean us like the rain in spring  
Take the chlorine out our conversation  
Let Your light reflect on me  
I promise I'm not hiding anything  
It's water  
We are water  
Pure as water  
Like a newborn daughter  

_[Ant Clemons:]_  
The storm may come  
But we'll get through it because of Your love  
Either way, we crash like water  
Your love's water  
Pure as water  
We are water  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Jesus, flow through us  
Jesus, heal the bruises  
Jesus, clean the music  
Jesus, please use us  
Jesus, please help  
Jesus, please heal  
Jesus, please forgive  
Jesus, please reveal  
Jesus, give us strength  
Jesus, make us well  
Jesus, help us live  
Jesus, give us wealth  
Jesus is our safe  
Jesus is our rock  
Jesus, give us grace  
Jesus, keep us safe  

_[Ant Clemons:]_  
Clean us like the rain in spring  
Take the chlorine out our conversation  
Let Your light reflect on me  
I promise I'm not hiding anything  
It's water  
We are water  
Pure as water  
Like a newborn daughter  

_[Kanye West:]_  
We like water, mmh  
We like water  
Well, right  
So, so well  
Well, right  
So, so  
High as the sun come out  
Plannin'  
Bootin'  
Plannin'  
Movin'  
Plannin'  
Tubin', there  
Well, well
