# Use This Gospel (feat. Clipse & Kenny G)

Use this gospel for protection  
It's a hard road to Heaven  
We call on Your blessings  
In the Father, we put our faith  
[[16. KING|King]] of the kingdom  
Our demons are tremblin'  
Holy angels defending  
In the Father, we put our faith  

_[Pusha T:]_  
How could He not be the greatest?  
In my bed, under covers, when under-covers had raided  
My presence is happy belated  
[[honored by my lateness|Fashionably late]], I'm just glad that you made it  
The best is yet to come, I'm just glad that you waited  
They all say they real 'til it's time to appraise it  
I seen them come and go, you only the latest  
But who am I to judge? I'm crooked as Vegas  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Use this gospel for protection  
It's a hard road to Heaven  
We call on Your blessings  
In the Father, we put our faith  
[[16. KING|King]] of the kingdom  
Our demons are tremblin'  
Holy angels defending  
In the Father, we put our faith  

_[No Malice:]_  
A lot of damaged souls, I done damaged those  
And in my [[use my arrogance as the steam|arrogance]] took a camera pose  
Caught with a trunk of Barry Manilows  
They sing a different tune when the slammer close  
From the concrete grew a rose  
They give you Wraith talk, I give you faith talk  
Blindfolded on this road, watch me faith walk  
Just hold on to your brother when his faith lost  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)  
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)  
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)  
Oh-oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)  
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)  
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)  
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)  
Oh-oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)
