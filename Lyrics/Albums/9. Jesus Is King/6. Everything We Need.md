# Everything We Need (feat. Ty Dolla $ign & Ant Clemons)

We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light (Woo, woo)  
Woo, woo, oh yeah  

Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Switch your, switch your attitude  
Go 'head, level up yourself  
This that different latitude  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Life too short, go spoil yourself  
Feel that feel, enjoy yourself 'cause  

We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)  
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)  
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)  
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, whoa)  
We have everything we need  

We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light (Oh, yeah)  

Switch my, switch my attitude  
I'm so, I'm so radical  
All these people mad at dude  
This for who it matter to  
What if Eve made apple juice?  
You gon' do what Adam do?  
Or say, "Baby, let's put this back on the tree" 'cause  

We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)  
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)  
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)  
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, whoa)  
We have everything we need  

We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light
