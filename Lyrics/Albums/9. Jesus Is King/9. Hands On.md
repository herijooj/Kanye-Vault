# Hands On

_[Fred Hammond:]_  
Hand 'em  
Hands up high, hands on, hands on  
Hands on, hands up  
In your face, the reason  
Hands on, yeah, hands on  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Cut out all the lights, He the light  
Got pulled over, see the brights  
What you doin' on the street at night?  
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights  
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes  
Made a left when I should've made a right  
Told God last time on life  
[[Told the devil that I'm going on a strike]]  
Told the devil when I see him, [[1. On Sight|on sight]]  
I've been working for you my whole life  
[[Told the devil that I'm going on a strike]]  
I've been working for you my whole life  
Nothing worse than a hypocrite  
Change, he ain't really different  
He ain't even try to get permission  
Ask for advice and they dissed him  
Said I'm finna do a gospel album  
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?  
They'll be the first one to judge me  
Make it feel like nobody love me  
They'll be the first one to judge me  
Feelin' like nobody love me  
Told people God was my mission  
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?  
They'll be the first one to judge me  
Make it feel like nobody love me  
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light  
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes  
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right  
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs  
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight  
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight  
From the love of religion  
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?  
They'll be the first one to judge me  
Make it seem like nobody love me  
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas  
But if I try to lead you to Jesus  
We get called halfway believers  
Only halfway read Ephesians  
Only if they knew what I knew, uh  
I was never new 'til I knew of  
True and living God, Yeshua  
The true and living God  
(Somebody pray for me)

Hand 'em  
Hands up high, hands on, hands on  
Hands on, hands up  
In your face, the reason  
Hands on, yeah, hands on  

_[Fred Hammond (Kanye West):]_  
I deserve all the criticism you got  
If that's all the love you have, that's all you got  
To sing of change, you think I'm joking  
To praise His name, you ask what I'm smoking  
Yes, I understand your reluctancy, yeah  
But I have a request, you see  
Don't throw me up, lay your hands on me  
Please, pray for me  
(Hold myself on death)  
Hold it down, all fallen down  
Somebody pray for me

Hand 'em  
Hands up high, hands on, hands on  
Hands on, hands up  
In your face, the reason  
Hands on, yeah, hands on
