# Homecoming

_[Kanye West:]_  
Yeah  
And you say [[Chicago|Chi]] city!  
[[Chicago|Chi]] city! [[Chicago|Chi]] city!  

_[Chris Martin and Kanye West:]_  
I'm comin' home again  
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)  
Do you think about me now and then?  
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)  
-Min' home again  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I met this girl when I was three years old  
And what I loved most, she had so much soul  
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me  
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees."  
And from that point, I never blow her off  
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off  
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off  
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft  
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown  
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'  
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be  
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave  
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me."  
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me  
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me  
She said, "'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!"  

_[Chris Martin:]_  
I'm comin' home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
'Cause I'm comin' home again  
-Min' home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!  
Now I'm comin' home again  
Maybe we can start again  

_[Kanye West:]_  
But if you really cared for her  
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams  
Sometimes I still talk to her  
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me  
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you  
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you  
But they just not you," and I just got through  
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new  
[[Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong]]  
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone  
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home  
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home  
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud  
Reach for the [[1. STARS|stars]], so if you fall, you land on a cloud  
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around  
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout [[Chicago|Chi-Town]] ^c3db19

_[Chris Martin:]_  
I'm comin' home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
'Cause I'm comin' home again  
-Min' home again  
Baby, do you remember when  
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!  
Now I'm comin' home again  
-Min' home again  
Baby, do you remember when  
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!  
Now I'm comin' home again  
Maybe we can start again  

_[Chris Martin:]_  
Loyal, loyal  
Comin' home again  
Loyal, loyal  
Comin' home again  
Maybe we can start again
