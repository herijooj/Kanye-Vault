# Can't Tell Me Nothing (Remix) (feat. Young Jeezy)

_[Kanye West and Young Jeezy:]_  
La, la, la, la  
8732 that's the way it go  
Wait 'til I get my money right  
Kanye and Jizzle, say it ain't so  

_[Young Jeezy:]_  
If I had a billion dollars (yeah)  
Yeah, I'd spend all in a day, show these niggas how to play (play)  
Top floor penthouse, I'll show them where I stay (stay)  
Grand piano, might learn to play (Ha ha!)  
Paid a hundred grand just to walk past it every day (Woo! Woo!)  
You know I like them white keys on it (yeah!)  
Duct tape when we wrap them, call me prejudice  
Cause I never touch the black ones (keys that is, ha ha!)  
Let me show how to do this, shawty! (shawty!)  
I hit the strip club and I blew bout forty (damn!)  
Patron got me so confused (fused)  
Until I stumbled outside and I made the news  
Fresh nine piece, yeah them wings is cajun  
Never seen me in the kitchen nigga, I am amazing (nah)  
Well, fuck it I'm rich then  
If balling is a crime, fuck it I'm hit then  
If thugging is a term, fuck it I'm it then  
The insane dough, hey, fuck it I'm sick then  
Somebody call me a shrink  
Until then, I'mma fix me a drink (Ha Ha!)  
Top down in the Bent, I'm so intoxicated  
Sometimes I think to myself "Goddamn, I made it"  
And I know they hate it  
On the all night flight  
Trying to get my money right, wassup?  

_[Kanye West (Young Jeezy):]_  
La la la la (hey!)  
Wait till I get my money right  
La la la la (yeah!)  
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?  
Excuse me, is you saying something?  
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (ha ha!)  
You can't tell me nothing  
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing  

_[Kanye West (Young Jeezy):]_  
Yeah, homie this a theme song  
First I get my money right, then I get my team on  
If I always prayed to have gleam on  
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?  
And I was high as a Leer Jet  
Fly as the insect, even though we in [[debt]]  
And it don't matter if I get her number cause  
When I get my money right she gon' come running  
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "o"  
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's  
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes  
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes  
Now my game so professional  
And my chain so fresh, they go (oh oh oh oh oh)  
Right after the fame did you gain anything?  
Damn 'Ye, would you change anything?  
But (If I had a billion dollars! Yeah)  
I'd copped more [[Pink Polo|pink polos]] and pop those collars  
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow  
My [[Benz]] need company, her nickname Tahoe  
"Wait 'til I get my money" everybody's motto  
So I'mma need a bravo for everything that I wrote  
Yeah, hey, mama they can't hate him  
'Cause after all of the drama, K slayed them   ^f95a7a

_[Kanye West (Young Jeezy):]_  
La la la la (hey!)  
Wait till I get my money right  
La la la la (yeah!)  
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?  
Excuse me, is you saying something?  
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (ha ha!)  
You can't tell me nothing  
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing  

_[Kanye West (Young Jeezy):]_  
(If I had a billion dollars yeah)  
Wait till I get my money right  
(If I had a billion dollars yeah)  
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?  

_[Connie Mitchell (Young Jeezy):]_  
(I'm serious, nigga! Hey!)  
Why were you late?  
(Yeah! Ha ha!  
Yeah! You know I'm serious, nigga! I got money!)  

Oh oh oh oh oh  
Good money made!  
Oh oh oh oh oh

Why were you late?  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Good money made!
