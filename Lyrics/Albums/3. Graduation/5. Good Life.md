# Good Life (feat. T-Pain)

_[Kanye West and T-Pain:]_  
Like we always do at this time  
I go for mine, I gots to shine  
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)  
I go go for mine, I gots to shine  
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)  
I'ma get on this TV momma, I'ma  
I'ma put shit down  
(Ayy) ayy (Ayy), ayy  
(Ayy) ayy (Ayy), I'm good  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Welcome to the good life, where niggas who sell D  
Won't even get pulled over in they new V  
The good life, let's go on a living spree  
Shit, they say the best things in life are free  
The good life, it feel like Atlanta  
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami  
It feel like NY, summertime [[Chi]]  
Ah! (Now throw your hands up in the sky)  
So I roll through good  
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari  
And she got the goods  
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!  

Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned  
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's  
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up  
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up"  
The good life  

_[Kanye West and T-Pain:]_  
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine  
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)  
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine  
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)  
(I'ma get on this TV momma, I'ma)  
(I'ma put shit down)  
Ayy (Ayy), ayy (Ayy)  
Ayy (Ayy), ayy (I'm good)  

_[Kanye West (T-Pain):]_  
Welcome to the good life!  
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV  
'Cause they got more (Ass than the models)  
The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles  
'Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo  
The good life, it feel like Houston  
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C  
It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay  
Ayy, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)  
Homie, tell me what's good  
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood (Welcome to the good life)  
Like I'm new in the hood  
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would (Welcome to the good life!)  
He probably think he could  
But, but, I don't think he should (Welcome to the good life)  
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up  
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up"  
The good life  

_[Kanye West and T-Pain:]_  
Now I, I go for mine, I gots to shine  
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)  
Now I, I go for mine, I gots to shine  
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)  
I'ma get on the TV momma, I'ma  
I'ma put shit down  
(Ayy) ayy (Ayy), ayy  
(Ayy) ayy (Ayy), I'm good  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain  
Whipped it out, she said, "I never seen Snakes on a Plane."  
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this  
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is  
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back  
Activated, I'm back to Vegas  
'Cause (The good life) I always had a passion for flashin'  
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life  

_[T-Pain:]_  
Better than the life I lived  
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy  
And now my grandmamma  
Ain't the only girl callin' me "baby"  
If you feelin' me now  
Then put your hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say  
Hey, hey, ooh I'm good!
