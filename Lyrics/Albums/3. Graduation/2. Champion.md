# Champion

Did you realize  
That you were a champion in their eyes?  

Yes, I did  
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a little something, show you how we live  
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious  
Mhm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' [[7. DO IT|do it]], [[7. DO IT|do it]] just like this  

Did you realize  
That you were a champion in their eyes?  

You don't see just how wild the crowd is  
You don't see just how fly my style is  
I don't see why I need a stylist  
When I shop so much I can speak Italian  
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids  
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects  
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit  
My dad'd say, "When you see clothes, close your eyelids."  
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son  
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones  
'Cause every summer he'd get some  
Brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from  
And I don't know what he did for dough  
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe, but ayy  

Did you realize  
That you were a champion in their eyes?  

I think he did  
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a little something, show you how we live  
Everything I wanted, man it seem so serious  
Mhm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' [[7. DO IT|do it]], [[7. DO IT|do it]] just like this  

Did you realize  
That you were a champion in their eyes?  

When it feel like living's harder than dyin'  
For me [[givin' up's way harder than tryin']]  
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion  
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'  
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?  
I guess me if it isn't you  
Last week I [[3. PAID|paid]] a visit to the institute  
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school  
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do  
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle  
They got the CD, they got to see me  
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE  
They used to feel invisible  
Now they know they invincible ^a71fdd

Did you realize  
That you were a champion in their eyes?  

This is the story of a champion  
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns  
Stand up, stand up, here he comes  
Tell me what it takes to be number one  
Tell me what it takes to be number one  
This is the story of a champion  
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns  
Stand up, stand up, here he comes  
Tell me what it takes to be number one  
Tell me what it takes to be number one
