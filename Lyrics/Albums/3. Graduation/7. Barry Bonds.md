# Barry Bonds

_[Kanye West:]_  
It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?  
What people pay paper for, damn it  
They can't stand it, they want something new  
So let's get re-acquainted, became the hood favorite  
I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'  
Comin' in the club wit' that fresh shit on  
Wit' somethin' crazy on my arm, uh-huh-hum  
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds  

_[Kanye West:]_  
We outta here, baby! We outta here, baby!  
We outta here, baby!  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Dude! Fresh off the plane—Konnichiwa, bitches  
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot  
Ask for it, I did it—that asshole done did it  
Talked it, then he lived it, spit it, then he shit it  
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas  
But only I could come up with some shit like this  
I done played the underdog my whole career  
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year?  
They say, "He goin' crazy and we seen this before"  
But [[I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go]]  
And I'm doing pretty hood in my [[Pink Polo]]  
Nigga, please, how you gon' say I ain't no Lo-head?  
'Cause my Dior got me more model head?  
I'm insulted, you should go 'head  
And bow so hard 'til your knees hit your forehead  
And the flow just hit code red  
Top five MCs, you ain't gotta remind me  
Top five MCs, you gotta rewind me  
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me  
But my head's so big, you can't sit behind me ^bc8062

_[Lil Wayne:]_  
Yeah, yeah, we outta here, baby!  
What? What? We outta here, baby!  
Ayy, Mr. West, we so outta here, baby!  
And me? I'm Mr. Weezy Baby, yeah!  

_[Lil Wayne:]_  
I'm so bright, not shady  
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady  
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated  
I'm so fuckin' good like I'm sleepin' with Meagan (Ha!)  
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns, and Reagans  
Whenever they make them, I shall have them  
Oops, I meant "have them"—I'm so crazy  
But if you play crazy, you be sleeping with daisies  
I'm such a havoc—oops, I meant "havoc"  
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit  
And I'm still col' like Keyshia's family  
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties (Bow!)  
And I ate it 'cause I'm so avid (No homo)  
And I don't front and I don't go backwards  
And I don't practice, and I don't lack shit  
And you can get buried—suck my bat, bitch (ha!)  

_[Kanye West & Lil Wayne:]_  
We outta here, baby!  
We outta here, baby!  
We outta here, baby!  
Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah!
