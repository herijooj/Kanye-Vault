# It Ain't Happen Yet, and That's What Intuition is

Do you even remember what the issue is?  
You just trying to find where the tissue is  
You can still be who you wish you is  
[[4. I Wonder#^442694|It ain't happen yet, and that's what intuition]] is (And I wonder)  
When you hop back in the car  
Drive back to the crib, run back to their arms  
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams  
You ever wonder what it all really means?
