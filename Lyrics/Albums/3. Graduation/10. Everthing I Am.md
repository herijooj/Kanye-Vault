# Everthing I Am

Damn, here we go again  
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam  
Now [[Everything I'm not made me everything I am]]  
Damn, here we go again  
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
[[Everything I'm not made me everything I am]]  

I'll never be picture-perfect Beyonc√©  
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey  
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was black as the street was  
[[I'll never be laid back as this beat was]]  
I never could see why people'll reach a  
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up  
You see how I creeped up?  
You see how I played a big role in [[Chi|Chicago]] like Queen Latifah?  
I'll never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam  
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am  
Let me know if you feel it, man  
'Cause [[Everything I'm not made me everything I am]]  

Damn, here we go again  
Everybody saying what's not for him  
But [[Everything I'm not made me everything I am]]  
Damn, here we go again  
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
[[Everything I'm not made me everything I am]]  

And I'm back to tear it up  
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up  
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops  
[[They forget to get their hair cut]]  
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up  
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough  
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos  
[[Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows]]  
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award  
Goodbye to the India Arie Award  
They'd rather give me the N-nigga Please Award  
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award ^4c5822

Damn, here we go again  
Bum-tu-bum-bum-bum  
But [[Everything I'm not made me everything I am]]  
Damn, here we go again  
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
[[Everything I'm not made me everything I am]]  

I know people wouldn't usually rap this  
But I got the facts to back this  
Just last year, [[Chi|Chicago]] had over 600 caskets  
Man, killing's some wack shit  
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'  
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?  
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland  
I need to talk to somebody, pastor  
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay  
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay  
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say  
[[That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today]] ^807262

Damn, here we go again  
Everybody saying what's not for him  
But [[Everything I'm not made me everything I am]]  
Damn, here we go again  
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
[[Everything I'm not made me everything I am]]
