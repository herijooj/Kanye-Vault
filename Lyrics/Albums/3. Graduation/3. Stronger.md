_[Daft Punk:]_  
Work it, make it, do it, makes us  
Harder, better, faster, stronger  

_[Kanye West and Daft Punk:]_  
N-Now th-that that don't kill me  
Can only make us stronger  
I need you to hurry up now  
'Cause I can't wait much longer  
I know I got to be right now  
'Cause I can't get much wronger  
Man, I've been waiting all night now  
That's how long I been on ya  
(Work it harder, make it better  
Do it faster, makes us stronger)  
(I need you right now!)  
(More than ever, hour after hour  
Work–)  
(I need you right now!)   ^c8553d

_[Kanye West:]_  
Let's get lost tonight  
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight  
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight  
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?  
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior  
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore  
I ask, 'cause I'm not sure  
[[Do anybody make real shit anymore_|Do anybody make real shit anymore?]]  
Bow in the presence of greatness  
'Cause right now, thou hast forsaken us  
You should be [[honored by my lateness]]  
That I would even show up to this fake shit  
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit!  
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit  
Act like you can't tell who made this  
New Gospel, homie, take six  
And take this, haters! ^96054b

_[Kanye West and Daft Punk:]_  
I don't know if you got a man or not  
If you made plans or not  
If God put me in your plans or not  
I'm trippin', this drink got me saying a lot  
But I know that God put you in front of me  
So how the hell could you front on me?  
There's a thousand you's, [[there's only one of me]]  
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?  
'Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night  
So we gon' do everything that Kan like  
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike  
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke  
And she'll do [[anything for the limelight]]  
And we'll do anything when the time's right  
Uh, baby, you're makin' it–
