# I Wonder

_[Labi Siffre:]_  
Find your dreams come true  
And I wonder  
If you know  
What it means  
What it means  
And I wonder  
If you know  
What it means  
What it means  
And I wonder  
If you know  
What it means  
To find your dreams, and I wonder  

_[Kanye West and Labi Siffre:]_  
I've been waiting on this my whole life (And I wonder)  
These dreams be waking me up at night (And I wonder)  
[[You say I think I'm never wrong]] (And I wonder)  
You know what? Maybe you're right  
Aight? ^57aaa5

_[Labi Siffre:]_  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means to find your dreams  
And I wonder  

_[Kanye West and Labi Siffre:]_  
You say he get on your fucking nerves (And I wonder)  
You hope that he get what he deserves—word! (And I wonder)  
Do you even remember what the issue is?  
You just trying to find where the tissue is  
You can still be who you wish you is  
[[It ain't happen yet, and that's what intuition is]] (And I wonder)  
When you hop back in the car  
Drive back to the crib, run back to their arms  
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams  
You ever wonder what it all really means? ^442694

_[Kanye West and Labi Siffre:]_  
[[And I'm back on my grind]]  
A psychic read my lifeline, told me in my lifetime  
My name would help light up the [[Chicago]] skyline  
And that's why I'm (And I wonder)  
Seven o'clock, that's prime-time  
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines  
Why he keep giving me hot lines?  
[[I'm a star—how could I not shine]]? (And I wonder)  
How many ladies in the house? (If you know)  
How many ladies in the house without a spouse? (What it means)  
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused (What it means)  
What you about? (And I wonder)  
On that independent shit (If you know)  
Trade it all for a husband and some kids (What it means)  
You ever wonder what it all really mean?  
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?  
To find your dreams come true ^abb12a
