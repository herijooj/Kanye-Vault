# Big Brother

Stadium status  

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother  
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother  
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend  
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin  

It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout  
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out "Jigga"  
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out  
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout  
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy  
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi  
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by  
Back of my mind, "He could change your life  
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it  
At least you can brag to your friends back at the gig"  
But he got me out my momma crib  
Then he help me get my momma a crib  

Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother  
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother  
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend  
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin  
Let the story begin  
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?  

Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline  
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine  
'Round the same time of that Blueprint 1  
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him  
I'd play my little songs in that old back room  
He'd bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"  
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out  
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd  
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square  
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but  
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it  
Carline told me I could buy two tickets  
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different  
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance  
But everything that I felt was more bogus  
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent  
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over  
I guess I'll understand when I get more older  
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem  
[[Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum]]  

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother  
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother  
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend  
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin  
Let the story begin  
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?  

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?  
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito  
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw  
I was always on the other side of the peephole  
Then I dropped "[[7. Jesus Walks|Jesus Walks]]" now I'm on the steeple  
And we know, "New Jack City"—got to keep my brother  
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother  
On that "[[13. Diamonds From Sierra Leone (remix)|Diamonds]]" remix I swore I [[Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows|spazzed]]  
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass  
Sibling rivalry, only I could see  
It was the [[pride]] in me that was drivin' me  
At the Grammys I said, "I inspired me"  
But my big brother who I always tried to be  
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll  
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go  
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk  
And my shit was more like a finger roll  
But I had them singles though  
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know  
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay  
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay  
Back in my mind I'm like, "Damn, no way"  
Translate, español: "No way, José"  
Then I went and told Jay Brown  
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around  
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first  
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse  

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother  
So here's a few words from your kid brother  
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em  
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em  
A idol in my eyes, god of the game  
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain  
Never be the same, never be another  
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother  

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother  
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother  
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend  
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends  

Toomp killed this shit
