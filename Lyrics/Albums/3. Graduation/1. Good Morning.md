# Good Morning

_[Kanye West:]_  
Good morning!  
Good morning!  
Good morning!  
Good morning!  

_[Kanye West:]_  
[[1. Wake Up Mr. West|Wake up Mr. West]], Mr. West  
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed  
I mean damn, did you even see the test?  
You got D's, motherfucker D's, Rosie Perez  
And your ass barely passed any and every class  
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test  
I guess, this is my dissertation  
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to [[Graduation]]  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Good morning!  
Good morning!  
Good morning!  
Good morning!  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Good morning, on this day we become legendary  
Everything we dreamed of  
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary  
Detroit Red cleaned up  
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key  
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets  
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came  
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Good morning!  
Good morning!  
Good morning and—  
Good morning!  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Good morning and look at the valedictorian  
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean  
Scared to face the world, complacent career student  
Some people graduate, but be still stupid  
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around  
Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus  
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness  
After all of that you received this  

_[Kanye West and JAY-Z:]_  
Good morning!  
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down  
Every time that we hear them  
Good morning!  
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down  
Every time that we hear them  
Good morning!  
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down  
Every time that we hear them  
Good morning!  
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down  

_[JAY-Z:]_  
Get on down  
Get— get on down  
Get on down  
Get— get on down
