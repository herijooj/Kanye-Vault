# I Love Kanye

[[I miss the old Kanye]], straight from the 'Go Kanye  
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye  
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye  
The always rude Kanye, [[Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows|spaz]] in the news Kanye  
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye  
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye  
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes  
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes  
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye  
I even had the [[Pink Polo|pink Polo]], I thought I was Kanye  
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye?  
Called "[[I miss the old Kanye]]"?  
Man that'd be so Kanye  
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye  
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye ^f3d9cf
