# 30 Hours (feat. André 3000)

_[Arthur Russell:]_  
Baby lion goes  
Where the islands go  

_[Kanye West:]_  
You say you never saw this comin', well, you're not alone  
Million dollar renovations to a happy home  
[[My ex says she gave me the best years of her life]]  
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right  
I wake up, assessin' the damages  
Checkin' MediaTakeOut  
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch  
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out  
I wake up, all veggies no eggs  
[[I hit the gym, all chest no legs]]  
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie  
Yeah, [[then me and wifey make a movie]]  
[[Chicago]] – St. Louis, St. Louis to [[Chicago]]  
Ándale, ándale E.I., E.I., uh-oh  
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone  
[[You was the best of all time at the time though]]  
Yeah, you wasn't mine though ^b85f92

_[Kanye West:]_  
But I still drove 30 hours  
And I, I still drove 30 hours to you, yeah  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam  
Young producer just trying to get his flows off  
I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret  
'Til I [[pictured everybody with they clothes off]]  
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition  
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December  
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, like a private school for women  
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl  
You don't love me, you just pretendin'  
[[I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin']]  
[[Chicago]], St. Louis, St. Louis to [[Chicago]]  
It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know  
Got a hotel room, three stars for you  
You call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning  
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria  
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me  
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'  
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs  
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time  
Well, [[I guess a blowjob's better than no job]] ^0d8c6e

_[Kanye West:]_  
And I drove back 30 hours  

_[Arthur Russell:]_  
Where the main ties onto the sail  
Better on sighting  
For astern, oh
