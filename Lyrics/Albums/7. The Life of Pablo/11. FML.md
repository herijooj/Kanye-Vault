# FML (feat. The Weeknd)

_[Kanye West:]_  
I been waiting for a minute  
For my lady  
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes  
I been living without limits  
As far as my business  
I'm the only one that's in control  
I been feeling all I've given  
For my children  
I will die for those I love  
God, I'm willing  
To make this my mission  
Give up the women  
Before I lose half of what I own  
I been thinking  
About my [[She saw the vision|vision]]
Pour out my feelings  
Revealing the layers to my soul  
My soul  
The layers to my soul  
Revealing the layers to my soul  

_[The Weeknd:]_  
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up  
Can't let them get to me  
And even though I always fuck my life up  
Only I can mention me  

_[Kanye West:]_  
See, before I let you go  
One last thing I need to let you know  
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than  
This nigga when he off his Lexapro  
Remember that last time in Mexico?  
Remember that last time, the episode?  
Asking me [[why the hell I text in code]]?  
Four times just to say, "Don't text me, ho"  
Told you four times, "Don't test me, ho"  
And we finna lose all self-control  
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me  
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store  
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end  
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho  
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh Indian  
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho  
And Iâ€¦  

_[The Weeknd:]_  
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up  
Can't let them get to me  
And even though I always fuck my life up  
Only I can mention me  
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up  
Can't let them get to me  
And even though I always fuck my life up  
Only I can mention me  

_[Kanye West and Section 25:]_  
See through the veil  
And forget all of your cares  
Throw them  
Throw them away  
Don't stop your loving  
Don't stop for nothing  
No, not for nothing  
They don't wanna see me love you  
Don't now, don't stop it  
They always love it  
They always wanna  
They don't wanna see me love you  
See through the veil  
They don't wanna see me love you  
And forget all your cares  
They don't wanna see me love you  
Throw them  
Throw them away  
Ooh, life's a feeling and  
Ooh, the body is a feeling, yeah
