# Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1 (feat. Kid Cudi)

_[Pastor T.L. Barrett and Future:]_  
You're the only [[3. Power|power]] ([[3. Power|Power]])  
You're the only [[3. Power|power]] that can  
You're the only [[3. Power|power]] ([[3. Power|Power]])  
You're the only [[3. Power|power]] that can  
Oh, oh, oh, father…  
(If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)  

_[Kid Cudi and Pastor T.L. Barrett:]_  
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe  
Who can I turn to?  
Nothin' unwanted  
After all, who can I turn to?  
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe  
If I don't turn to you  
Nothin' unwanted  
No other help I know, I stretch my hands  

_[Kanye West and Pastor T.L. Barrett:]_  
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na  
Who can I turn to?  
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na  
After all, who can I turn to?  
If I ever instigated, I am sorry  
If I don't turn to you  
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I  
No other help I know, I stretch my hands  

_[Kanye West and Kelly Price:]_  
Now, if I fuck this model  
And she just bleached her asshole  
And I get bleach on my T-shirt  
[[I'ma feel like an asshole]]  
I was high when I met her  
We was down in Tribeca  
She'll get under your skin if you let her  
She'll get under your skin if you-uh  
I don't even wanna talk about it  
I don't even wanna talk about it  
I don't even wanna say nothin'  
Everybody gon' say somethin'  
I'd be worried if they said nothin'  
Remind me where I know you from  
She lookin' like she owe you some'n  
You know just what we want  
I wanna wake up with you in my…  
I wanna wake up with you in my… ^c9621e

_[Kid Cudi, Pastor T.L. Barrett and Kelly Price:]_  
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe  
Who can I turn to?  
Beautiful mornin'  
Nothin' unwanted  
After all, who can I turn to?  
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe  
If I don't turn to you  
Nothin' unwanted  
No other help I know, I stretch my hands  

_[Kanye West and Pastor T.L. Barrett:]_  
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na  
Who can I turn to?  
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na  
After all, who can I turn to?  
If I ever instigated, I am sorry  
If I don't turn to you  
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I  
No other help I know, I stretch my hands
