# Saint Pablo (feat. Sampha)

_[Kanye West:]_  
Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time  
Back in the lab and shit  

_[Kanye West:]_  
My wife said, "I can't say no to nobody"  
And at this rate we gon' both die broke  
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in [[debt]]  
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no  
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter  
My friends' best advice was to stay low  
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills  
Especially when you got family members on payroll  
The media said it was outlandish spendin'  
The media said he's way out of control  
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'  
[[I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control]]  
[[I know I'm the most influential]]  
That TIME cover was just confirmation  
[[This generation's closest thing to Einstein]]  
[[So don't worry about me, I'm fine]]  
I can see a thousand years from now in real life  
Skate on the [[paradigm]] and shift it when I feel like  
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question  
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive  
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission  
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions  
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission  
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different  
Never listen to Hollywood producers  
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa  
The ultimate Gemini has survived  
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25   ^cc3fa1

_[Sampha:]_  
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi  
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife  
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)  
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi  
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah  

_[Kanye West:]_  
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come  
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums  
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro  
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho  
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation  
He sat back and smiled  
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime  
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime  
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook  
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, "How my neck look?"  
Well, it all looks great  
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains  
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard  
Real family stick together and see through the mirage  
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality  
Who the real owner if your boss gets your salary?  
I am one with the people  
I am one with the people (Real!)  
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream  
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowd-source my self-esteem  
Let me not say too much or do too much  
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch  
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen  
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'  
God, I have humbled myself before the court  
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort  
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams  
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me  
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me  
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me  
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me  
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see  
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov  
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove  
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks  
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke  
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go  
We all go  
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo  
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo  
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow  

_[Sampha:]_  
Nightlife, walk all over me  
Walk all over me  
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring  
Fly, fly, fly overseas  
Fly overseas  
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between  
Oh, yeah  

_[Sampha:]_  
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi  
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife  
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi  
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)  
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife  
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)  

_[Sampha:]_  
Please face me when I speak  
Please say to me somethin' before you leave  
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you  
Oh, the invisible truths they sold  
I can't quite understand the games you play  
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath  
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore  
But I'm cryin' at the bar  
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man  
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me  
And looked at me like you knew me  
But I feel so alone  
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above  

_[Sampha:]_  
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi  
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife  
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)  
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi  
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky  
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife  
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
