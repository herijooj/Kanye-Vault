# No More Parties in LA (feat. Kendrick Lamar)

_[Johnny "Guitar" Watson and Junie Morrison:]_  
La-di-da-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)  
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (La-a, la-a, la-a)  
Let me tell you, I'm out here  
From a very far away place  
All for a chance to be a star  
Nowhere seems to be too far  

_[Kanye West, Junie Morrison and Ghostface Killah:]_  
No more parties in L.A.  
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh  
No more parties in L.A.  
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh  
No more (Los Angeles)  
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)  
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)  
Please (Shake that body, party that body)  

_[Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West:]_  
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans  
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan  
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man  
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"  
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty  
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie  
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler  
I show you the ropes, connect the dots  
A country girl that love Hollywood  
Mama used to cook red beans and rice  
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite  
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection  
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians  
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers  
Music and iPhone cameras  
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think  
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean  
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class  
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag  
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?  
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck  
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper  
I said baby, "Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"  
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence  
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is  
The head still good, though; the head still good, though  
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"  
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical  
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles  
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal  
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me  
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday  
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place  
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek  
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee  
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets  
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity  
And yeah, G, I was all for it  
She said, "K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet  
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie  
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy"  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Scary, scary  
No more parties in L.A.  
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Friday night, tryna make it into the city  
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty  
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place  
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base  
A [[backpack]] nigga with luxury tastebuds  
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs  
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous  
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list  
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired  
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired  
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired  
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir  
[[Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary]]  
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries  
For all my niggas with babies by bitches  
That use their kids as meal tickets  
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father  
The next generation will be the real victims  
I can't fault 'em, really  
I remember Amber told my boy  
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly  
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'  
Of weak content and [[12. Slow Jamz|slow jammin']]  
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'  
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'  
I be thinkin' every day  
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades  
I be [[6.  Paranoid|paranoid]] every time, the pressure  
[[The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin']]  
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired  
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died  
[[How Ye doing? I'm survivin'|Textin' and drivin']] down Mulholland Drive  
That's why I'd rather take the 405  
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim  
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him  
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents  
What I'm supposed to do?  
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?  
Every agent I know, know I hate agents  
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant  
[[Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance]]  
[[It's just me, I do it my way, bitch]]  
[[Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans]]  
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans  
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again  
But the writer's block is over; MCs, cancel your plans  
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems  
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it  
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out  
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out  
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam  
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam  
[[Thank God for me!]] (Los Angeles)  
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!  
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full  
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful  
[[I feel like Pablo]] when I'm workin' on my shoes  
[[I feel like Pablo]] when I see me on the news  
[[I feel like Pablo]] when I'm workin' on my house  
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out  
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots  
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like [[7. RoboCop|Robocop]] ^06917f

She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that  
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that  
She push me back when the dick go too deep  
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep  
Get money (Money, money, money)!  
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)  
And as far as [[12. Real Friends|real friends]], tell all my cousins I love 'em  
Even the one that [[I had a cousin that stole my laptop|stole the laptop]], you dirty motherfucker! ^9f78f6

_[Larry Graham:]_  
I just keep on lovin' you, baby  
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla

_[Kanye West, Junie Morrison and Ghostface Killah:]_  
Please, no more parties in L.A. (Shake that body, party that body)  
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh (Shake that body, party that body)  
No more parties in L.A. (Los Angeles)  
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh  
No more parties in L.A.  
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh  

_[Junie Morrison:]_  
Let me tell you, I'm out here from a very far away place  
All for a chance to be a star  
Nowhere seems to be too far  
Swish
