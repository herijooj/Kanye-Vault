# Low Lights

You want me to give you a testimony about my life  
And how good he's been to me  
I don't know what to tell you about him  
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul  
With every bone in my body I love him so much  
Because he's done so much for me  
Every morning  
Every day of my life  
I won't always be crying tears  
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up  
By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day  
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do  
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it  
How I'm gonna get there, because heâ€¦  
He's gonna be there for me  
Some day the sky above will open up  
And he will reach out his hand and guide me through  
Oh yes he will  
I won't always be crying these tears  
I won't always be feeling so blue  
Some day, he will open up the door for me  
And call my name  
Some day he will  
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like  
No matter what you've been through  
Or where you've been he's always there  
With his arms open wide  
Accepting me  
For who I am  
And I love him so much  
I couldn't [[7. DO IT|do it]] without him I wouldn't want to  
I'm crying now  
[[And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free|It feels so good to be free]]
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what  
Oh lord thank you  
You are the joy of my life
