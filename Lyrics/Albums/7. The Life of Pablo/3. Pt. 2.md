Faaaaaaaa— (Perfect)

I told, I told, ayy-ayy, I told you  

_[Kanye West:]_  
Up in the mornin', miss you bad  
Sorry I ain't call you back, same problem my father had  
All this time, all he had, all he had  
And what he dreamed, all his [[Debt|cash]]  
Market crashed, hurt him bad  
People get divorced for that  
Dropped some stacks, pops is good  
Mama passed in Hollywood  
If you ask, lost my soul  
Drivin' fast, lost control  
Off the road, [[19. Through the Wire|jaw was broke]]  
'Member we all was [[Debt|broke]]  
'Member I'm comin' back  
I'll be takin' all the stacks, oh  

_[Desiigner and Kanye West:]_  
I got broads in Atlanta  
Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta  
Stacks, oh  
Credit cards and the scammers  
Hittin' off licks in the bando  
Takin' all the stacks, oh  
Black X6, Phantom  
White X6 looks like a panda  
Stacks, oh  
[[Going out like I'm Montana]]  
Hundred killers, hundred hammers  
Black X6, Phantom  
White X6, panda  
Pockets swole, Danny  
Sellin' bar, candy  
Man I'm the macho like Randy  
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy  
Bitch nigga, pull up ya panty  
Hope you killas understand me  

_[Kanye West and Desiigner:]_  
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I (Hey)  
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I (Panda)  
Panda, panda, panda, panda  
Takin' all the stacks, oh  
Panda, panda, panda  
Stacks, oh  
Takin' all the stacks, oh  

_[Desiigner and Kanye West:]_  
I got broads in Atlanta  
Twist the dope, lean and shit, sippin' Fanta  
Stacks, oh  
Credit cards and the scammers  
Wake up Versace, shit life Desiigner  
Takin' all the stacks, oh  
Whole bunch of lavish shit  
They be askin' 'round town who be clappin' shit  
I be pullin' up stuff in the Phantom ship  
I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti, whip look how I try this shit  
Black X6, Phantom  
White X6, killin' on camera  

_[Pastor T. L. Barrett:]_  
My joy  

_[Caroline Shaw:]_  
How can I find you?  
Who do you turn to?  
How do I bind you?  

_[Pastor T. L. Barrett:]_  
If I don't turn to you  
No other help I know, I stretch my hands
