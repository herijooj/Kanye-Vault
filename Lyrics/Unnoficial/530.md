# 530 (The Car's Missing / Dear Summer)

Baby, yeah  
Oh, baby  
You pick up when you call  
Yeah  

5:30, the car missing  
No texts back, so calls missin'  
I feel like we all victims  
Nights gettin' long  
Drunk texting, I should not do Patrón  
I hop on the phone, turn the music up, got in my zone  
Drunk texting, I should probably sue Patrón  
Had to do wrong order to do you right  
You gotta go through in order to give advice  
It's the price of the litty nights  
I know the liquor hittin'  
Why when somebody break your heart it help fix your vision?  
If-if you fall in love with a demon or a diva, pray your soulmate got a soul when you meet her  
The crystal ball couldn't tell me if they'll leave again  
Problems too extra large to share with a medium  
We fight not for flesh and blood on this level  
And devil's advocate is advocatin' for the devil  
And love is all draining and stop, it's all fatal  
We used to be secretive, but now it's all blatant and it's all just lost, ain't it?  
Watching it all cave in  
We're the topic of conversation  
5:30, the car missing  
No texting, just call missin'  
We fight and you won't listen  
You right, we both trippin'  
It's game time, matter of fact, it's Ye time  
The past year has been a strange time  
Visitations on FaceTime  
And who gon' break who's heart first? Always just breaks mine  
Looking for blessings that God had hand me  
I'm trying to just raise the family, somebody should raise the nanny  
I'm trying to leave you alone  
But that last text was courtesy of Patrón  
5:30, the car missin'  
Emotions is all distant  
No texts, just calls missin'  
We fight and you won't listen  
You right, we both trippin'

Daddy didn't know  
Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, oh, ooh  

5:30 the car missin'  
Is this what you call distance?  
One shot, you called a glass prison?  
5:30 for our last visit  
That did it, well, well that did it  
That gets it, uh, that did it  
Mad with it, the thought that we had did it  
Everybody want too much of us  
Everybody except for us  
I don't know what's left of us  
Writing what's left of us  
Tryna write what's left of us  
Tryna write what's left of us  
I don't want nothing else  
Everybody except for us  
Everything they said it was  
Everything they read it was  
I know that I bet it was  
I don't know, I forget it does  
I don't know, I forget it does  
You know it was, you know it is  
You know the kid, you know we did, and I overdid  
And I'm going again, and I'm going in  
Time to go with it, my fault for holdin' in it  
I know I can't take it, I can't take it  
You a fake bitch  
You don't really love Ye, go listen to Drake, bitch  
You don't live in 'em songs, don't know what it take, bitch  
Go listen to Lil Baby, go listen to Future, bitch  
Do somethin', you don't think about your future, bitch  
When you done you gon' find I ain't new with this  
Best friend tryna find out what do with this  
Tryna pass judgement know me like I ain't shit  
Too much of a burden for you fake bitch  
You don't really love Ye, go listen to Drake, bitch  
You don't have no idea what it take, bitch  
Go listen to Lil Baby, go listen to Future, bitch  
Turn bad know you don't think about your future, bitch  
Go listen to Lil Baby, go listen to Future, bitch  
Turn bad know you don't think about your future, bitch  
You don't love Ye, you love Moneybagg Yo  
Look where the sun is shining  
I don't love hoes  
Why they mad for?  
You a fake bitch  
Don't listen to Ye, go listen to Drake, bitch  
Go listen to Lil Baby, go listen to Future, bitch  
But If I learned somethin', you should learn your future, bitch  
And I hope your baby daddy was a fugitive  
And I hope you—  
And I hope—, you don't know what to do with this  

His last words were untrue  
This last text 'cause Patrón  
Did I say something wrong?  
Don't ask me, I'm—
