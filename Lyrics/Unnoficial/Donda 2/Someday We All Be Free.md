# Someday We All Be Free

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free  
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free  
Just wait and see, some day we'll all be free  
Take it from me, someday, someday, someday  

Wakin' up to "I can't do this anymore" texts (Woo)  
And the Bible said I can't have any more sex 'til marriage (Woo, woo)  
No drip 'til Paris (Paris)  
The meek shall flourish (Flourish)  
So where's my heiress? (Heiress)  
You wouldn't understand ('Stand)  
How thin this air is (Air is)  
Your friends just starin' (Starin')  
Everyone's a Karen (Karen)  
Claimin' that they care and (Care and)  
Wasn't given a fair hand (Fair hand)  
Gettin' called from parents (Parents)  
God calls for prayer rants (Prayers)  
Thou strong for their hands (Yeah)  
I forgot what fear is (Yee)  
I forgot what fear is (Woo)  
I forgot what fear is (Wee)  
Other than the fear of the almighty Yashua  
Who knew you before you knew who you was  
Wear a [[Donda]] tee 'fore you respond to me  
Y'all know honestly, y'all all honor me  
I know 'cause the headlines why she wanna leave  
You knew I [[3. Follow God|follow God]], so you should follow me  

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free  

I ain't never rocked with none of y'all, no way (No way)  
And I'm pullin' up in that white OJ (Ayy)  
Used to wear watch filled with the O'Sheas  
Jackson if you nasty  
[[Tweeted "death con," now we past three]]  
(It won't be long, take it from me, someday—)  
[[Tweeted "death con," now we past three]]  

Free, it won't be long  
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free  
Take it from me, take it from me, take it from me…  

Can we just kind of say like, you like  
You like the uniforms? But that's about it  
There's a lot of things that I love  
That I love, that I love, that I love  
(Love…)
