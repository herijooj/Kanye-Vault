# The Storm

[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign & _Ant Clemons_]  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light (_Woo, woo_)  
**Oh my god, Ronny!** (_Woo, woo_), oh yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West & _Ant Clemons_]  
_Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh_  
Switch your⁠—switch your attitude  
Go 'head, level up yourself  
This that different latitude  
_Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh_  
Life too short, don't troll yourself  
Feel that feel, enjoy yourself

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & _Ant Clemons_]  
Girl, you owe it to yourself (_Ooh-ooh, ooh_)  
_We began after the storm inside_  
Girl, you owe it to yourself (_Ooh-ooh, ooh_)  
Girl, you owe it to yourself (_Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh_)  
_We began after the storm inside_  
Girl, you owe it to yourself (_Ooh-ooh, ooh_)  
_Girl, you owe it to yourself_

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]  
Hmm, can't go once we get by (Hmm)  
We on, we on (Hmm)  
See, I'm gone, I'm too high (Hmm)  
We on, we on  
Fall back in time (Time) when I was weak (Weak)  
In for the ride, (Who knows) where I will be? (Yeah)  
Watchin' the sun go down (Faded!), the silent retreat (Hmm)  
I know you hit me when I'm lonely (Lonely), lift me off my feet

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light (_Woo, woo_)

[Verse 3: XXXTENTACION]

Actin' up, you actin' buff, you fuck 'round, you get murked  
These niggas bitches, mm, I get it  
Sauce, bitch, I'm with it, uh, I get it  
Shots at your fitted (Ayy), mm, I did it  
Yuh, I did it, yuh, I did it  
Niggas askin' where I get my drip at  
Told a nigga throw a backpack, nigga, back-back, hmm  
Asking for the money, where your racks at?  
If you ain't my brother, told a fuck nigga "Hush that", uh

And my wrist never like throwing shade, uh  
Came to the crib off of Kool-Aid, ayy

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light (Oh, yeah)  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign & _Ant Clemons_]  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light (Oh, yeah)  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light
