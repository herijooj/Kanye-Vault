# The Storm

[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign & _Ant Clemons_]  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light (_Woo, woo_)  
**Oh my god, Ronny!** (_Woo, woo_), oh yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West & _Ant Clemons_]  
_Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh_  
Switch your⁠—switch your attitude  
Go 'head, level up yourself  
This that different latitude  
_Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh_  
Life too short, don't troll yourself  
Feel that feel, enjoy yourself

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & _Ant Clemons_]  
Girl, you owe it to yourself (_Ooh-ooh, ooh_)  
_We began after the storm inside_  
Girl, you owe it to yourself (_Ooh-ooh, ooh_)  
Girl, you owe it to yourself (_Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh_)  
_We began after the storm inside_  
Girl, you owe it to yourself (_Ooh-ooh, ooh_)  
_Girl, you owe it to yourself_

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]  
Hmm, can't go once we get by (Hmm)  
We on, we on (Hmm)  
See, I'm gone, I'm too high (Hmm)  
We on, we on  
Fall back in time (Time) when I was weak (Weak)  
In for the ride, (Who knows) where I will be? (Yeah)  
Watchin' the sun go down (Faded!), the silent retreat (Hmm)  
I know you hit me when I'm lonely (Lonely), lift me off my feet

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light (_Woo, woo_)

[Verse 3: XXXTENTACION]  
Okay, I'm turnt  
At the party,

Actin' up, you actin' buff, you fuck 'round, you get murked  
These niggas bitches, mm, I get it  
Sauce, bitch, I'm with it, uh, I get it  
Shots at your fitted (Ayy), mm, I did it  
Yuh, I did it, yuh, I did it  
Niggas askin' where I get my drip at  
Told a nigga throw a [[backpack]], nigga, back-back, hmm  
Asking for the money, where your racks at?  
If you ain't my brother, told a fuck nigga "Hush that", uh  
Cartier, Cartier, throwing shade, uh  
Asian bitch really like to crochet, uh  
And my wrist never like throwing shade, uh  
Came to the crib off of Kool-Aid, ayy

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light (Oh, yeah)  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign & _Ant Clemons_]  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light (Oh, yeah)  
We began after the storm inside  
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light
