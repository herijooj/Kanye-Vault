# Spread Your Wings

[Verse 1]  
Off the meds, off the head  
Niggas soft as bread, niggas soft as bread  
Stay off them blogs, they play with y'all thoughts  
Made a way from my dawgs that ain't say what they saw  
Only the brave, they want us locked in the cage  
If you owe me money, I shouldn't have to remind you to pay  
Vacheron with my Ralph Lauren  
How this bitch a full time leech and still beg on the side?  
Off the meds, can't get out of the bed  
Paparazzi waitin' like that mall on the _Da__wn of the Dead_  
I don't know you, my dawg, step away from the bus  
Know they want me to fall, but my balance is just  
You weren't with me when them struggles and battles was tough  
So I cut your head off 'fore I give you a cut  
When they tell me I can't do it, it give me a rush  
Ain't got this type of bank account 'less you 50 and up  
They on my muhfuckin' dick, all this dirt they tryin' get  
Go with whoever, I ain't got no pick  
Come through just to get that flick  

[Bridge]  
Get back, go down  
New 'Rari, slow down  
Check the score, blow out  
I'm a bull like the home town  

[Verse 2]  
Yeezys on, Yeezy bomber, wear my own designer  
Name good, all my bridges open, go wherever, that's power  
She came from the club tryna fuck, bitch, get in the shower  
You a kid to me, boy, I prolly fucked your mama  
Hunnid Ms, you did that? Baddest chick in the world, you hit that?  
Took your bitch, you miss that?  
All the fake buyers, bitch, get back  

[Chorus]  
Yeah, get back, get back  
Hunnid rounds, no kickback  
Mansion party, lil' kickback  
Champagne, gon' sip that  
Get that, get back  
Hunnid rounds, no kickback  
Mansion party, lil' kickback  
Fake vibes, we ain't with that  

[Verse 3]  
Look what they doin', look what they sayin'  
"That nigga selfish, look at his mansion"  
Thirty thousand square feet, secret rooms, look at the plan  
Look at the money, look at the bands  
I get on my knees, I'm thankin' the man  
He said he ain't like that nigga, I just seen him shakin' his hand  
I'm shakin' my head, I'm shakin' my head  
You like that Benz? They made it in France

[Chorus]  
But watch your hands, get back  
Get back, get back  
Hunnid rounds, no kickback  
Mansion party, lil' kickback  
Fake vibes, we ain't with that  
Champagne, gon' sip that  
Hunnid rounds, no kickback  
All the fake vibes, I ain't with that  

[Outro]  
My life a mofo, spot like some UFO  
Price tag upon your soul, you sold it, you gotta go  
Trade my respect for some attention? Fuck no  
Lookin' at these bitches bodies, girl, y'all overdose  
Why y'all overdose?
