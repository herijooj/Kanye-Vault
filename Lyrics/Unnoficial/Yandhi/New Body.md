# New Body

[Intro]  
_Oh my God, Ronny!_  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Can't wait to see your new body  
Don’t be actin’ like you don’t know nobody  
No body count on your new body  
I’ll be the first one to hit your new body, woah  

[Verse 1: Kanye West]  
New ass, new tits, new bitch, who this?  
Who else you know this bad with two kids?  
Nobody ever, ever gave you shit  
Nobody flew to Colombia, like you did  
Trying a new ass out with the new drip  
Only thing to ask, who first to hit?  
‘Cause far as you ‘cern you is a new bitch  
There dumb, I’m done now, them niggas is too rich  
Old dick don’t count, these titties don’t bounce  
These niggas say they here tryna run up your account  
Big dump on it now, the summer they was down  
But they better act like they know who they fuckin’ now  
This a new bitch  
Got a party table at the Ruth Chris  
All bad bitches take a group pic  
Had to step back ‘cause she too thick  
You used to twerk to every, every song  
Saved up to buy an ass of your very, very own  
FaceTime, body looks like Dom Perignon  
Don't pay me no attention, go and carry on  

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & _Nicki Minaj_]  
Can't wait to see your new body  
Don’t be actin’ like you don’t know nobody

Got me a new body, now I need some new dick  
No little wood, tryna stick me like a toothpick  
Got me a new body, now I need some new dick

Old nigga hit me and I said, “New body, who this?” (Ooh)

New body, you’ve been workin’ hard (Hard)

New boobie job, now they perfect  
Six weeks off, it was worth it (Worth)  
Baby got that nip tuck, let me titty fuck (Fuck)  
Hit it from the back, get my dick sucked (Huh?)  
Put me on the scoreboard, make a new one

You’re workin’ on your abs, huh? You got your ass done  
You better show it all, you better work it (Work)  
Why they body shamin’? Baby, I commend it (Lend)
