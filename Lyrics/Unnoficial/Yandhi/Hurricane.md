# Hurricane (Yandhi)

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]  
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave  
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring  
Eighty degrees, warmin' up for me  
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave  
Open my eyes and see  
We will float over [[7. Water|water]], leaning into shore  
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure  
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Verse: Kanye West]  
[[I chose not to be a slave]]  
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave  
Like we ain't have all the hood rats in Mud Rats  
Like you ain't had 'em, good stats and all that  
Nobody gon' ruin me  
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free  
I put all my ice up and my Louis V  
I just copped my momma crib, I'm back over East  
Let me get your ear like Holyfield  
From the home of Soldier Field  
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels  
All that killing over, that's just overkill  
Yeezy back in the [[Chicago|Chi]], this that Oprah field

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]  
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave  
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring  
Eighty degrees, warmin' up for me  
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave  
Open my eyes and see  
We will float over [[7. Water|water]], leaning into shore  
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure  
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Verse 2: Big Sean]  
Woah, woah, yeah, yeah  
Look, my life is exciting as Dennis Rodman's (Woah)  
[[1. STARS|Stars]] intertwine, my soul back in alignment  
If we don't have the same vision, no point in exchanging contact (No)  
Only ex I love running into is at the end of my contracts, yeah  
Bottom line, I'm seeing through the mask of the fakes  
Like we're at the Comic Con, I point 'em out from time to time  
Speaking of time, me and my mom been gettin' closer  
Either I took her for granted or didn't know her  
Or is it, I'm getting older?  
Or is it, Luke is finally turning into Yoda?  
Only new beginnings, no such thing as over  
We should have just stayed friends  
That never opened up or needed closure (God)  
God, give me directions like Noah  
Not on no hopeless romantic shit  
But I can't wait to see Ye get back with HOVA  
Look bitch, this the new chain of command (Bitch)  
Might bring the Pow chains back like me and Ye in Japan  
Cudi back at it again, Push, yeah that's 'til the end, yeah  
Just like it should have been  
Nothing but that G.O.O.D. and the G around us  
I knocked down the walls and my head free my mind up (Woah)  
I didn't chase the game, ho, I helped redesign it, yeah  
Goin' against us, you need logic, Muhammad  
I'm so fuckin' conscious, that shit is my compass, yeah, yeah  
Don

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]  
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave  
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring  
Eighty degrees, warmin' up for me  
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave  
Open my eyes and see  
We will float over [[7. Water|water]], leaning into shore  
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure  
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Chorus: Kanye West]  
Seasons changing  
'Fore life start for me  
'Fore life start for me  
Thoughts and thoughts to me  
Eighty degrees  
Warmin' up to me  
I did it free  
I did know, indeed  
And I run out to sea  
I can walk on the [[7. Water|water]]  
Honey, I want you  
I can float on the [[7. Water|water]]  
Father, hold me close  
Don't let me down  
I know you won't

[Chorus: Kanye West]  
See this in 3D  
'Fore life start for me  
'Fore life start for me  
Thoughts and thoughts to me  
80 degrees  
Warmin' up to me  
I did it free  
I did know, indeed  
And I run out to sea  
I can walk on the [[7. Water|water]]  
Honey, I want you  
I can float on the finer  
Father, hold me close  
Don't let me down  
I know you won't

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]  
Oh yeah, ooh yeah  
Who really loves me? Somebody loves me (Ooh yeah)  
Who really wants me? Who really cares about me?  
Said I remember when you left me buy my grandma's house  
Yeah, I remember when you let me buy my grannie's house  
You ain't my nigga if you ain't ever been by my grandma's house (No)  
This ain't real love if we never fuck on my grandma's couch (No)  
Nobody loves me, can't trust nobody  
Don't want no fake niggas around me, don't need nobody (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]  
Light it up, yo yo yo y'all can't hear me  
Yo yo yo yo, turn me up turn me up turn me up  
Light it up, pipe it up, [?] they invited us  
They excited us, with they [?], what they write us  
Couldn't write it up  
[?], They ain't light enough, They ain't do enough  
He ain't do enough, They was going off, They was cool with us  
'Til we [[7. DO IT|do it]] up, Then we do the most, Then we do the most  
[?]  
[?], [?], …Getting you to vote  
Hold em… [?], In the thunderstorm  
It's a hurricane, It's a [?], For the better things  
[?], [?], Then I let it bang  
[?]… For a better chain, Get a better name  
[?]… But I bet he playin  
But I bet he playin  
But I bet he playin

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]  
See I feel so free  
Cool like summer breeze  
Cool like summer breeze  
God's all over me  
Like eighty degrees  
And wind that hits the leaves  
I feel so free  
God's all over me  
And the whole world can see  
His love flows just like [[7. Water|water]]  
Look, it overflows  
Nothing's too hard for God  
Father, hold me close  
Don't let me down  
I know You won't
