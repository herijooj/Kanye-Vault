# True Love (Unreleased)

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]  
True love shouldn't be this complicated  
[[Thought I'd die in your arms]]  
I thought I'd die in your—  
True love shouldn't be this complicated  
[[Thought I'd die in your arms]]  
I thought I'd die in your—  

[Verse: Kanye West]  
No hard feelings, but these feelings harder  
When I think about it, my eyes fill up with water  
[[Don't have our daughters butterfly while they larvae]]  
Wait, when you see the kids? I'll see y'all tomorrow  
Wait, when the sun set? I see y'all tomorrow  
Wait, when I pick 'em up, I feel like they borrowed  
When I gotta return them, scan 'em like a bar code  
Wait, no hard feelings, but these feelings hard though  
Wait, who got the kids in those "What are those?"  
Wait, why they can't wear Yeezys with the cargos?  
Y'all know Nike don't like me, y'all take it too far, though  
At least have 'em in some Mike's, he played for [[Chicago]]  
I only see three kids, who watchin' Chicago?  
And you know all the nannies is Donnie Nesbrasco  
Let the kids dig a tunnel to my house like Chapo  
Only neighbor in the hood with a door they can knock on  
I leave the light on  

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & _Kanye West_]  
True love (_Daddy's not gone_) shouldn't be this complicated  
(_You see the light on_)  
[[Thought I'd die in your arms]] (_Daddy's at home_)  
I thought I'd die in your— (_Tell Gekyume_)  
True love (_Daddy's not gone_) shouldn't be this complicated (_Tell Gekyume_)  
[[Thought I'd die in your arms]] (_Daddy's at home_)  
I thought I'd die in your—  

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]  
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah  
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah (Love)  
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah  
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah
