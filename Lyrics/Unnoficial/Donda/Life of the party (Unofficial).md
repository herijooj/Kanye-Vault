# [[28. Life of the Party|Life of the Party]] Unofficial

[Intro: Kanye West]  
It's after hours at that glamorous blind spot  
Where they're taking it easy, swapping personal experiences  
Let's listen in America Today  
Life of the party, mhm, 'til I almost cry, mhm  
It's the [[28. Life of the Party|life of the party]] to think I could've almost died  
Lord, help us  

[Verse 1: André 3000]  
Hey, Miss [[Donda]]  
You run into my mama; please tell her I said, "Say something"  
I'm startin' to believe ain't no such thing as heaven's trumpets  
No after-over, this is it, done  
If there's a Heaven, you would think they'd let ya speak to your son  
Maybe she has in the form of a baby's laugh I heard  
Passing by in a stroller remindin' me, "Hey, keep rolling"  
I don't know; maybe she has with a prick of a blade of grass  
I've been layin' on way too long, got me itchy  
Got up and roamed a lil' more  
Miss [[Donda]], you see my mama, tell her I'm lost  
You see, she'd always light a cigarette, we'd talk, I would cough  
Exaggeratin' a lil' bit, so she get the point  
Tryna get her to stop smokin', I would leave and fire up a joint  
'Til I quit, started back up again, twenty years later  
All that time, y'all thought nigga was high, thought I was crazy  
My mom, she ain't cut no corners  
Got me back on track; I don't miss her overstepping  
But do miss her showin' Seven civilian life shit  
Ah, Miss [[Donda]], you see my mama whisper her this:  
The real reason I was geeked to go to church  
Must confess, when y'all grown-ups would be in Bible study  
That girl helping me with my homework? Her and I were fuckin'  
So pure and perverted, so spirit spinning and dirty  
So on, so on and so on, we hoped that no one heard us  
Sh-sh, ah, ah  
And to this day, I think her mama knew but let us explore  
Miss [[Donda]], you see my father, please, ask him:  
Why he never married? Always smiled, but was he happy inside?  
Because I carried my mother's name, did he carry shame with him?  
I'm sure she did it out of spite; 'twas her decision at birth  
Shit, she probably was hurt, ah, poor baby  
Two young people with different views, a lot for a young lady  
No coincidence, they both passed away from heart conditions  
There's a dissidence at play; dad and mom do hard division  
Three Thou', poster child for big dick niggas raised by their mothers  
I'm supposed to smile as if God knew that I would be troubled  
Keeps me around, for what? I don't know  
But I do know that it's crucial that we do so, pronto  
I don't know how much long though  

[Verse 2: Kanye West, DMX & Diddy]  
[[Mama, your son in the red hat]]  
Had suffered set-backs, had, "shouldn't-have-said-thats"  
Had made everyone mad  
He made "[[808s & Heartbreak|808s]]" so he's everyone dad, know he ever gets sad  
Hotel rooms by the shore, close my eyes, I can see more  
Nobody punkin' me, nobody pressure me, nobody gangsta me  
Especially when the gangstas eat thanks to me  
And my favorite principal name was Mrs. Wooten  
She was strict, the perfect instructor for young Putin  
Vladimir, just so that is clear  
Whom should we fear when we know Dad is here?  
Daddy's right here, Daddy's right here  
I don't play, boy  
Over y'all dead body 'fore my daughter pose in Playboy  
We don't condone over-sexualization of the kids in the home  
Battery in my back  
This house of pain won't ever last  
CyHi told me to my face that "SICKO MODE" was his biggest song  
Well go'n 'cause [[Donda]] was the best ghostwriter I ever had  
[[Choke a South Park writer with a fish-stick|South Park had jokes about fish sticks]]  
'Til this day, the whole team [[Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass|can kiss this dick]]

I put Virgil and Drake on the same text  
And it wasn't about the matching Arc'teryx or Kid Cudi dress  
Just told these grown men, "Stop it with the funny shit"  
I might hire the whole team from ACG  
So don't text me like I'm Juanita JCV  
Or more important, Monica Corgan, who was there for me  
Somebody really there for me was rare for me  
That was new air to breathe  
When I was underappreciated, undervaluated  
Stockholders told me, "Board rooms will bore you"  
Can't remember going by your rules, try to follow the Lord's rules  
Thought we was the new Abu Dhabi  
Told Drake "Don't play with me on GD"  
And he sent that message to everybody  
[[If I hit you with a "W-Y-D?"|So if I hit you with a "W-Y-D"]]  
You better hit me with, "Yes sir, I'm writing everything you need"  
I told you I was gonna take the summer back  
So any of the cap, won't take none of that  
[[Mama, your son in the red hat|Where my motherfuckin' red hat?]]  
Security and the nannies be [[forever]] handling  
I can't stand it when there's talks about puttin' the kids back in  
Sierra Canyon when daddy got his own school  
Trav, smile for these white people if you want (C'mon)  
While we build a team to get Hoover out the joint  
I do what I want, bro, in my life  
Serve and protect long as it's my wife  
Screaming on M-A-N's for trying to lower the percentage of SKIMS  
See, I was going in  
Back when they thought I was only making Ms, now it's nine-billi'  
You ain't gotta like me, but you feel me ^de3e05

[Bridge: Kanye West]  
Do y'all feel me? Really?  
Get off Scott Free, I'm talking Ridley  
Get off our knees, that's if you're with me  
Get off your knees, that's if you're with me  
Get off your knees and let's get free  
Get off your knees and let's get free  
Really, I mean really  
Really, I mean really  
I need release, I don't need police  
I'm like, "nigga, please"  
Y'all can't hear me, (Harmonizing), for the real me  
For the real me, I mean, mhmm-mm  

[Outro: DMX]  
Alright, it's gonna shoot us in thewoah, uh-oh, uh-oh  
Ready mama? (Yup)  
I'm so proud of you, yup, you're gonna have so much fun  
They gonna shoot us in the air, mama, okay?  
C'mon, P, I got you, it's okay, mama  
Hold your head back, hold your head back (Three, two, one)  
Daddy's here, daddy's here, daddy's right here  
It's okay, mama, daddy's here, daddy here  
Help, help, daddy's right here, I'm scared  
Okay, okay, I got you, it's okay  
Okay, we goin' slow, we goin' slow down  
It's okay, stop cryin', daddy got you, see, it's over, you did it, P!  
You already did it! See? It's already over! Yay! You did it!  
Big Girl! It's already over! It's already over, it's already over  
Daddy right here, daddy right here  
I told you I'm not gon' let you go  
I'm not gon' let you go, mama, okay?  
Daddy got you, daddy gon' bring us all the way down, okay?  
How was it? (We good)  
You did a good job (It was scary)  
Good job!

[Intro]  
It's after hours at that glamorous blank spot  
Where they're taking it easy, swapping personal experiences  
Let's listen in America Today  
Boy  

[Refrain 1]  
Straight from Shibuya, on some zen  
I'm back, ramped up, I'm on ten  
I know revenge is saved only for Him  
But it's hard to make amends when mens just gon' be mens  

[Verse]  
The white picket got me feeling so fenced in  
[[Bipolar]] don't equal seekin' attention  
That's that psy-that's that psychology  
Gemini inside of me, it's my dichotomy  
Sendin' Christ publicists to get the Christ out of mе  
Just to mention His name is a glitch in the gamе  
Break all the chains, I ain't had a drink in over 21 days  
Certain summers was a bummer, momma made minimum wage  
Everybody rocking J's, I couldn't get 'em for days  
She was the [[only one]] that knew that I would get to that stage  
Guess who wouldn't be shocked by anything that I say?  
It's getting kinda heavy like when rain broke the levy  
We livin' in the years where tears become deadly  
And my favorite art teacher name was Mrs. Levy  
'Round the time, I learned to put my feelings to a medley  
I ain’t turn in homework for bout' like 4 months and I bet she let me  
[[She saw the vision]]  
"Yeezy you special' go make your own decisions then"  
Yeah, that was a good choice, faith driving us like a Rolls Royce  
They tried to take my voice away, I ain't tryna take the choice away  
I just pray the [[7. Water|water]] break, just for my daughter sake, from a sip-up  
Fake signatures from fake managers, it all damage her, good Lord  
Give 'em enough of they own rope to hang 'em with  
[[The paparazzi never really got what my angle is]]  
They treat my family like, like some type of entertainment  
My neighbors still dissin', wonderin' why I ain't saying it  
I can smell the setup, that's that 2Pac in Vegas hit  
I revealed myself and some don't know what to make of it  
[[8. God Is|God is]] sending you something, make sure that the baby live  
And if [[Ye]] ain't here, then tell me who gonna say this shit?  
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a goddamn minute  
Let me stop playing with it, God playing 'round with it  
Popped in a Lamb with it, in a damn pandemic  
Know that Uncle Sam gotta have his damn hand in it  

[Refrain 2]  
Look, straight from Shibuya, on some zen, I'm on ten  
It's a marathon and yet we coming for the win  
Just like Puff told Christopher we gon' win big (C'mon)  
Put the whole family on, look at what my Kim did  
Just like Puff told Christopher we gon' win big (Uh)  
Uh, we gon win big, woah (What?)
